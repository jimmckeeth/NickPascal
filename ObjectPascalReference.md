## Document Conventions

### EBNF Notation

This specification uses Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) to describe the syntax.

| Notation   | Meaning                                |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `=`        | Definition                             |
| `;`        | End of production rule                 |
| `\|`       | Alternation (choice)                   |
| `( )`      | Grouping                               |
| `[ ]`      | Optional (zero or one)                 |
| `{ }`      | Repetition (zero or more)              |
| `' '`      | Terminal string (literal)              |
| `" "`      | Terminal string (alternate delimiters) |
| `-`        | Exception (set difference)             |

### Terminology

- **shall** — mandatory requirement for a conforming implementation
- **should** — recommended but not mandatory
- **may** — optional behavior
- **undefined behavior** — the specification imposes no requirements
- **implementation-defined** — behavior defined by each implementation and documented

Keywords appear in **`bold monospace`** and are shown in lowercase. The language is **case-insensitive**: `Begin`, `BEGIN`, and `begin` are identical tokens.

## Chapter 1: Lexical Structure

### 1.1 Source Text Encoding

A conforming implementation shall accept source files encoded in:

- UTF-8 (with or without BOM)
- UTF-16 LE (with BOM)
- Windows-1252 (CP1252) / ISO 8859-1 (legacy)

When a UTF-8 BOM (`EF BB BF`) or UTF-16 BOM (`FF FE`) is present, the implementation shall use the indicated encoding. In the absence of a BOM, the implementation shall assume a default encoding (implementation-defined; typically UTF-8 or the system ANSI code page).

String literals and comments may contain any Unicode code point permitted by the source encoding. Identifiers are restricted as specified in §1.4.

### 1.2 Line Structure

Source text is divided into lines. A line terminator is one of:

- U+000D U+000A (CR LF) — Windows convention
- U+000A (LF)
- U+000D (CR)

Line numbers are used in error messages and `{$LINE}` directives. The first line of a source file is line 1.

### 1.3 Lexical Elements Overview

The lexical analysis phase (tokenization) converts source text into a sequence of tokens. The categories of tokens are:

1. **Reserved words** (keywords)
2. **Identifiers**
3. **Directive words** (context-sensitive identifiers)
4. **Numeric literals**
5. **String literals**
6. **Operators and delimiters**
7. **Comments**
8. **Compiler directives**

White space (spaces U+0020, horizontal tabs U+0009, and line terminators) serves to separate tokens and is otherwise ignored, except within string literals.

### 1.4 Identifiers

```
IDENTIFIER = LETTER , { LETTER | DIGIT | '_' } ;
LETTER     = 'A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z' | '_' ;
DIGIT      = '0'..'9' ;
```

Rules:

1. Identifiers are **case-insensitive**. `MyVar`, `myvar`, and `MYVAR` all refer to the same entity.
2. Identifiers may begin with a letter or underscore, followed by zero or more letters, digits, or underscores.
3. The **significant length** of an identifier is 255 characters. Characters beyond position 255 are ignored for purposes of identity comparison.
4. An identifier that matches a **reserved word** (§1.5) cannot be used as a user-defined identifier unless prefixed with `&` (the escaped identifier prefix). The `&` is not part of the identifier name; `&begin` refers to an identifier named `begin`.
5. Identifiers matching **directive words** (§1.6) may be used as user-defined identifiers, but this is discouraged.

#### 1.4.1 Qualified Identifiers

```
QUALIFIED_IDENT = [ UNIT_NAME '.' ] IDENT ;
UNIT_NAME       = IDENT { '.' IDENT } ;
```

A qualified identifier uses dot notation to resolve ambiguity. `System.SysUtils.StrToInt` refers to the identifier `StrToInt` declared in unit `System.SysUtils`.

### 1.5 Reserved Words

Reserved words have fixed meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers (except via the `&` prefix). The complete list:

```
and          exports      mod          set
array        file         nil          shl
as           finalization not          shr
asm          finally      object       string
begin        for          of           then
case         function     on           threadvar
class        goto         operator     to
const        if           or           try
constructor  implementation out        type
destructor   in           packed       unit
dispinterface inherited   procedure    until
div          initialization program    uses
do           inline       property     var
downto       interface    raise        while
else         is           record       with
end          label        repeat       xor
except       library      resourcestring
```

Note: `inline` is a reserved word as of Delphi 2005 and later. In older versions it was a directive.

### 1.6 Directive Words

Directive words are context-sensitive: they have special meaning in specific syntactic contexts but may be used as identifiers elsewhere. A conforming implementation shall recognize the following directives:

```
absolute        dynamic         local           platform
abstract        experimental    message         read
assembler       export          name            readonly
automated       external        near            reference
cdecl           far             nodefault       register
contains        final           operator        reintroduce
default         forward         out             requires
delayed         helper          overload        resident
deprecated      implements      override        safecall
dispid          index           package         sealed
```

```
static          stored          varargs         writeonly
stdcall         strict          virtual         write
unsafe          winapi
```

### 1.7 Numeric Literals

#### 1.7.1 Integer Literals

```
INTEGER_LITERAL  = DECIMAL_LITERAL | HEX_LITERAL | OCTAL_LITERAL | BINARY_LITERAL ;
DECIMAL_LITERAL  = DIGIT { DIGIT } ;
HEX_LITERAL      = '$' HEX_DIGIT { HEX_DIGIT } ;
OCTAL_LITERAL    = '&' OCTAL_DIGIT { OCTAL_DIGIT } ;
BINARY_LITERAL   = '%' BIN_DIGIT { BIN_DIGIT } ;
HEX_DIGIT        = '0'..'9' | 'A'..'F' | 'a'..'f' ;
OCTAL_DIGIT      = '0'..'7' ;
BIN_DIGIT        = '0' | '1' ;
```

The type of an integer literal is the smallest of the following types that can represent the value: `Integer` (32-bit signed), `Cardinal` (32-bit unsigned), `Int64` (64-bit signed), `UInt64` (64-bit unsigned). If the value exceeds `UInt64` range, a compile-time error shall be issued.

Underscores may be used as digit separators within numeric literals (Delphi 11+): `1_000_000`, `$FF_FF`, `%1111_0000`. Underscores shall not appear at the beginning or end of the digit sequence, and consecutive underscores are not permitted.

#### 1.7.2 Floating-Point Literals

```
FLOAT_LITERAL    = DIGIT_SEQ '.' DIGIT_SEQ [ EXPONENT ]
                 | DIGIT_SEQ EXPONENT ;
DIGIT_SEQ        = DIGIT { ['_'] DIGIT } ;
EXPONENT         = ('E' | 'e') [ '+' | '-' ] DIGIT_SEQ ;
```

Floating-point literals are of type `Extended` (80-bit on Win32, 64-bit/`Double` on Win64 and other 64-bit platforms). If the literal has no decimal point and no exponent, it is an integer literal, not floating-point.

### 1.8 String Literals

```
STRING_LITERAL   = QUOTED_STRING { CHAR_LITERAL QUOTED_STRING }
                 | CHAR_LITERAL { QUOTED_STRING CHAR_LITERAL }
                 | QUOTED_STRING
                 | CHAR_LITERAL ;

QUOTED_STRING    = "'" { STRING_CHAR | "''" } "'" ;
STRING_CHAR      = (* any character except "'" and line terminators *) ;
CHAR_LITERAL     = '#' ( DECIMAL_LITERAL | HEX_LITERAL ) ;
```

Rules:

1. A single-quoted string `'Hello'` represents a string of characters.
2. Within a quoted string, two consecutive apostrophes `''` represent a single apostrophe character.
3. A `#` prefix followed by a decimal or hex integer specifies a character by its ordinal value. `#65` is the character `A`. `#$41` is also `A`.
4. Adjacent quoted strings and char literals are concatenated at compile time: `'Hello'#13#10'World'` yields a string containing `Hello`, a CR/LF, and `World`.
5. A string literal of length 1 is compatible with both `Char` and `string` types.
6. A string literal of length 0 (`''`) represents the empty string.
7. String literals are **not** null-terminated in their Pascal representation, but the runtime ensures a null terminator is present for interoperability with C APIs.

#### 1.8.1 Multi-Line String Literals

As of Delphi 12, multi-line string literals are supported using the triple-quoted syntax:

```
MULTILINE_STRING = "'''" { ANY_CHAR } "'''" ;
```

Rules:

1. Everything between the opening `'''` and closing `'''` is part of the string, including line breaks.
2. The opening `'''` must be followed by a line terminator; the content begins on the next line.
3. The closing `'''` must appear on its own line, preceded only by optional whitespace.
4. The leading whitespace of the closing `'''` line determines the *indentation prefix*. This prefix is stripped from each content line.
5. The resulting string uses the platform's native line ending.

### 1.9 Comments

```
COMMENT = LINE_COMMENT | BLOCK_COMMENT_BRACE | BLOCK_COMMENT_PAREN ;
LINE_COMMENT         = '//' { ANY_CHAR_EXCEPT_NEWLINE } LINE_TERMINATOR ;
BLOCK_COMMENT_BRACE  = '{' { ANY_CHAR_EXCEPT_CLOSE_BRACE } '}' ;
BLOCK_COMMENT_PAREN  = '(*' { ANY_CHAR_EXCEPT_STAR_PAREN } '*)' ;
```

Rules:

1. Comments are treated as white space (they separate tokens but produce no tokens themselves).
2. Comments do **not** nest. `{ { } }` — the first `}` ends the comment.
3. However, different comment styles **do not** interact: `{ (* } *)` — the `{` opens a brace comment; the `(*` inside it is just comment text; the `}` ends the brace comment; the `*)` is then a syntax error (or stray tokens). Conversely, `(* { *) }` — the `(*` opens a paren-star comment; the `{` is comment text; the `*)` ends the comment; the `}` is stray.
4. A `{` or `(*` that is immediately followed by `$` introduces a **compiler directive** (§17), not an ordinary comment.

### 1.10 Operators and Delimiters

#### 1.10.1 Single-Character Tokens

| Token | Name                  |
|-------|-----------------------|
| `+`   | Plus                  |
| `-`   | Minus                 |
| `*`   | Asterisk / Multiply   |
| `/`   | Slash / Real division |
| `=`   | Equals                |
| `<`   | Less than             |
| `>`   | Greater than          |
| `(`   | Left parenthesis      |
| `)`   | Right parenthesis     |
| `[`   | Left bracket          |
| `]`   | Right bracket         |
| `.`   | Dot                   |
| `,`   | Comma                 |
| `;`   | Semicolon             |
| `:`   | Colon                 |
| `^`   | Caret / Dereference   |
| `@`   | At sign / Address-of  |
| `#`   | Hash / Character literal prefix |
| `$`   | Dollar / Hex prefix   |
| `&`   | Ampersand / Escaped identifier prefix |

#### 1.10.2 Multi-Character Tokens

| Token  | Name                        |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| `:=`   | Assignment                  |
| `<>`   | Not equal                   |
| `<=`   | Less than or equal          |
| `>=`   | Greater than or equal       |
| `..`   | Range (subrange)            |
| `(.`   | Alternative for `[`         |
| `.)`   | Alternative for `]`         |
| `<<`   | Left shift (overloaded ops) |
| `>>`   | Right shift (overloaded ops)|

#### 1.10.3 Keyword Operators

The following reserved words function as operators:

| Keyword   | Operation                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `and`     | Bitwise/logical AND           |
| `or`      | Bitwise/logical OR            |
| `xor`     | Bitwise/logical XOR           |
| `not`     | Bitwise/logical NOT           |
| `div`     | Integer division              |
| `mod`     | Integer modulus               |
| `shl`     | Shift left                    |
| `shr`     | Shift right                   |
| `in`      | Set membership                |
| `is`      | Type test                     |
| `as`      | Type cast (checked)           |

### 1.11 Tokens — Maximal Munch Rule

When multiple token interpretations are possible, the lexer shall use the **maximal munch** rule: the longest possible sequence of characters that forms a valid token is consumed. For example, `>=` is one token (greater-than-or-equal), not `>` followed by `=`.

### 1.12 Implicit Semicolons and Statement Separation

Object Pascal uses **explicit semicolons** as statement separators (not terminators). A semicolon separates two statements; it does not terminate a single statement. Consequently:

- A semicolon before **`end`**, **`else`**, **`except`**, **`finally`**, or **`until`** is optional (it separates from an empty statement).
- A missing semicolon between two statements is a compile-time error.

## Chapter 2: Program Organization

### 2.1 Compilation Units

Object Pascal source code is organized into **compilation units**. There are three kinds:

1. **Program** — the main executable entry point.
2. **Unit** — a module containing declarations that can be used by other units or programs.
3. **Package** — a collection of units compiled into a shared library (BPL).

Additionally, a **Library** is a variant of a program that produces a dynamically linked library (DLL/SO) instead of an executable.

### 2.2 Programs

```
PROGRAM = PROGRAM_HEAD ';' [ USES_CLAUSE ]
          BLOCK '.' ;

PROGRAM_HEAD = 'program' IDENT [ '(' IDENT_LIST ')' ] ;
```

The optional `( IDENT_LIST )` after the program name is accepted for backward compatibility with ISO Pascal (file parameters) but is ignored by the compiler.

The **`block`** in a program constitutes the main body:

```
BLOCK = { DECLARATION_SECTION } COMPOUND_STATEMENT ;

DECLARATION_SECTION = CONST_SECTION
                    | TYPE_SECTION
                    | VAR_SECTION
                    | THREADVAR_SECTION
                    | LABEL_SECTION
                    | PROCEDURE_DECLARATION
                    | FUNCTION_DECLARATION
                    | EXPORTS_CLAUSE ;

COMPOUND_STATEMENT = 'begin' STMT_LIST 'end' ;
STMT_LIST          = [ STATEMENT { ';' STATEMENT } ] ;
```

The compound statement between `begin` and `end` is the program's entry point. Execution begins there after all unit initialization sections have executed.

### 2.3 Units

```
UNIT = UNIT_HEAD ';'
       INTERFACE_SECTION
       IMPLEMENTATION_SECTION
       [ INITIALIZATION_SECTION ]
       [ FINALIZATION_SECTION ]
       'end' '.' ;

UNIT_HEAD = 'unit' UNIT_NAME [ PORTABILITY_DIRECTIVE ] ;

UNIT_NAME = IDENT { '.' IDENT } ;
```

A unit name may contain dots, forming a **dotted unit name** (e.g., `System.SysUtils`). The dots are part of the unit name, not scope resolution operators. The source file name shall match the unit name with dots replaced by periods and an extension of `.pas` (e.g., `System.SysUtils.pas`).

#### 2.3.1 Interface Section

```
INTERFACE_SECTION = 'interface'
                    [ USES_CLAUSE ]
                    { INTERFACE_DECL } ;

INTERFACE_DECL = CONST_SECTION
               | TYPE_SECTION
               | VAR_SECTION
               | THREADVAR_SECTION
               | PROCEDURE_HEADER ';' [ DIRECTIVE_LIST ';' ]
               | FUNCTION_HEADER ';' [ DIRECTIVE_LIST ';' ] ;
```

The interface section declares all entities that are **publicly visible** to other units. Procedure and function declarations in the interface section provide only the **header** (signature); the implementation (body) is in the implementation section.

#### 2.3.2 Implementation Section

```
IMPLEMENTATION_SECTION = 'implementation'
                         [ USES_CLAUSE ]
                         { DECLARATION_SECTION } ;
```

The implementation section contains:

1. The **bodies** of all procedures and functions declared in the interface section.
2. Additional **private** declarations (types, constants, variables, procedures, functions) that are not visible outside the unit.
3. An optional `uses` clause that imports units needed only in the implementation.

#### 2.3.3 Initialization and Finalization Sections

```
INITIALIZATION_SECTION = 'initialization' STMT_LIST ;
FINALIZATION_SECTION   = 'finalization' STMT_LIST ;
```

Alternatively, the initialization section may use the older syntax:

```
INITIALIZATION_SECTION = 'begin' STMT_LIST ;
```

(In this form, there can be no finalization section.)

**Execution order:**

1. **Initialization sections** execute in **dependency order**: if unit A uses unit B, then B's initialization executes before A's. Among units used in the same `uses` clause, initialization proceeds left to right.
2. **Finalization sections** execute in **reverse** dependency order when the program terminates.
3. A unit's initialization section executes at most once, even if the unit is used by multiple units.

#### 2.3.4 Circular Unit References

Two units may reference each other under the following constraint:

- At most one of the two circular `uses` references may appear in an **interface** section. The other must be in the **implementation** section.
- If both references are in interface sections, a compile-time error shall be issued.

### 2.4 The Uses Clause

```
USES_CLAUSE = 'uses' USES_ENTRY { ',' USES_ENTRY } ';' ;
USES_ENTRY  = UNIT_NAME [ 'in' STRING_LITERAL ] ;
```

The `in` clause specifies the source file path for the unit, used when the file name does not match the unit name or when the file is in a non-standard location. The path is relative to the file containing the `uses` clause.

**Scope rules for `uses`:**

1. Identifiers from a used unit are brought into scope as if qualified by the unit name.
2. Unqualified access is permitted if the identifier is unambiguous.
3. If two or more used units declare the same identifier, the **last** unit in the `uses` clause takes precedence for unqualified references. Other declarations can be accessed via qualification.
4. The interface `uses` clause is visible to both the interface and implementation sections. The implementation `uses` clause is visible only to the implementation section.

### 2.5 Libraries

```
LIBRARY = 'library' IDENT ';'
          [ USES_CLAUSE ]
          BLOCK '.' ;
```

A library compiles to a dynamic-link library (DLL on Windows, .so on Linux, .dylib on macOS). The block's compound statement (`begin..end`) serves as the DLL entry point (called on `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`).

### 2.6 Packages

```
PACKAGE = 'package' IDENT ';'
          [ REQUIRES_CLAUSE ]
          [ CONTAINS_CLAUSE ]
          'end' '.' ;

REQUIRES_CLAUSE = 'requires' IDENT_LIST ';' ;
CONTAINS_CLAUSE = 'contains' USES_ENTRY { ',' USES_ENTRY } ';' ;
```

Packages are groups of units compiled into a single BPL (Borland Package Library). Packages support:

- **`requires`** — declares dependencies on other packages.
- **`contains`** — lists units included in this package. A unit may appear in only one package.

### 2.7 Exports Clause

```
EXPORTS_CLAUSE = 'exports' EXPORTS_ENTRY { ',' EXPORTS_ENTRY } ';' ;

EXPORTS_ENTRY = IDENT [ '(' FORMAL_PARAMS ')' ]
                [ 'name' STRING_LITERAL ]
                [ 'index' INTEGER_LITERAL ]
                [ 'resident' ] ;
```

The `exports` clause makes procedures and functions available for dynamic linking from a library or program.

- **`name`** — specifies the exported name (may differ from the Pascal identifier).
- **`index`** — specifies a numeric ordinal for the export (Windows only).
- **`resident`** — keeps the export name in memory for faster lookup (legacy, largely ignored).

### 2.8 Namespaces and Scope

#### 2.8.1 Scope Levels

Object Pascal has the following scope levels, from innermost to outermost:

1. **Block scope** — local variables in a `begin..end` block (including nested procedure/function scopes).
2. **Record/class scope** — members of a record or class.
3. **Unit scope (implementation)** — declarations in the implementation section.
4. **Unit scope (interface)** — declarations in the interface section.
5. **Used unit scopes** — declarations imported via `uses` clauses.
6. **Predefined scope** — built-in identifiers (`Integer`, `WriteLn`, `True`, etc.).

Name lookup proceeds from innermost to outermost scope. The first match is used. An inner declaration **shadows** an outer declaration of the same name.

#### 2.8.2 The `with` Statement and Scope

The `with` statement (§6.14) temporarily adds record/class member scopes to the current scope chain, creating potential for ambiguity. See §6.14 for details.

#### 2.8.3 Unit Namespace Resolution

When a dotted unit name like `System.SysUtils` is used, the compiler attempts to match the longest possible prefix as a unit name. Given `System.SysUtils.StrToInt`:

1. Is `System.SysUtils.StrToInt` a known unit? No.
2. Is `System.SysUtils` a known unit containing `StrToInt`? Yes → resolved.

## Chapter 3: Types

### 3.1 Type System Overview

Object Pascal is a **statically typed**, **strongly typed** language. Every variable, constant, and expression has a type determined at compile time. Types are organized in a hierarchy:

```
Type
├── Simple Types
│   ├── Ordinal Types
│   │   ├── Integer Types
│   │   ├── Character Types
│   │   ├── Boolean Types
│   │   ├── Enumerated Types
│   │   └── Subrange Types
│   └── Real (Floating-Point) Types
├── String Types
│   ├── ShortString
│   ├── AnsiString
│   ├── UnicodeString (default "string")
│   ├── WideString
│   └── RawByteString
├── Structured Types
│   ├── Array Types
│   │   ├── Static Arrays
│   │   └── Dynamic Arrays
│   ├── Record Types
│   ├── Set Types
│   └── File Types
├── Pointer Types
├── Procedural Types
│   ├── Procedure/Function Pointers
│   ├── Method Pointers
│   └── Anonymous Method Types (method references)
├── Variant Types
├── Class Types
├── Class-Reference Types (Metaclasses)
├── Interface Types
└── Generic Types (Parameterized Types)
```

### 3.2 Type Identity and Compatibility

#### 3.2.1 Type Identity (Structural vs. Nominal)

Object Pascal uses **nominal typing**: two types are identical if and only if they refer to the same type declaration, or one is defined as equal to the other.

```pascal
type
  T1 = Integer;    // T1 is identical to Integer (type alias)
  T2 = Integer;    // T2 is identical to Integer (and to T1)
  T3 = type Integer; // T3 is a DISTINCT type (not identical to Integer)
```

The **`type`** keyword before a type name in a type declaration creates a **distinct type** that is assignment-compatible but not identical. Distinct types have their own RTTI.

#### 3.2.2 Assignment Compatibility

A value of type `S` is assignment-compatible with type `T` if any of the following is true:

1. `S` and `T` are identical types.
2. `S` is a subrange of `T`, or `T` is a subrange of `S`, or both are subranges of the same base type.
3. `S` and `T` are both ordinal types and the value of `S` is in the range of `T`.
4. `S` and `T` are both real types.
5. `S` is an integer type and `T` is a real type.
6. `S` and `T` are both string types.
7. `S` is a string type and `T` is `Char`, or vice versa (with length constraints).
8. `S` and `T` are compatible set types.
9. `S` is a descendant of `T`'s class type (widening), or `T` is an interface implemented by `S`.
10. `S` is `nil` and `T` is a pointer, class, class-reference, interface, procedural, or dynamic-array type.
11. `S` is a procedural type compatible with `T` (matching parameter lists and calling convention).
12. `S` is `Variant` and `T` is a type for which variant conversion is defined, or vice versa.

See Appendix D for the complete, formal rules.

### 3.3 Ordinal Types

Ordinal types are types whose values form a countable, ordered sequence. Every value has an **ordinal number** (an integer).

The following intrinsic functions operate on all ordinal types:

| Function    | Description                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Ord(X)`    | Ordinal number of `X`                  |
| `Pred(X)`   | Predecessor of `X`                     |
| `Succ(X)`   | Successor of `X`                       |
| `High(T)`   | Highest value of type `T`              |
| `Low(T)`    | Lowest value of type `T`               |

#### 3.3.1 Integer Types

| Type       | Size (bytes) | Range                                    | Signed |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| `ShortInt` | 1           | -128 .. 127                              | Yes    |
| `SmallInt` | 2           | -32768 .. 32767                          | Yes    |
| `Integer`  | 4           | -2147483648 .. 2147483647                | Yes    |
| `LongInt`  | 4           | same as `Integer`                        | Yes    |
| `Int64`    | 8           | -2^63 .. 2^63-1                          | Yes    |
| `Byte`     | 1           | 0 .. 255                                 | No     |
| `Word`     | 2           | 0 .. 65535                               | No     |
| `Cardinal` | 4           | 0 .. 4294967295                          | No     |
| `LongWord` | 4           | same as `Cardinal`                       | No     |
| `UInt64`   | 8           | 0 .. 2^64-1                              | No     |
| `NativeInt`| platform    | Signed, pointer-sized (4 or 8 bytes)     | Yes    |
| `NativeUInt`| platform   | Unsigned, pointer-sized                  | No     |

`Integer` is always 32 bits regardless of platform (unlike C). `NativeInt` and `NativeUInt` are pointer-sized and vary by target.

#### 3.3.2 Character Types

| Type       | Size (bytes) | Description                       |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| `AnsiChar` | 1           | 8-bit character (byte)            |
| `WideChar` | 2           | 16-bit Unicode character (UTF-16) |
| `Char`     | 2           | Alias for `WideChar`              |

`Char` is always `WideChar` in modern Delphi. The ordinal value of a character is its Unicode code point (for `WideChar`) or byte value (for `AnsiChar`).

#### 3.3.3 Boolean Types

| Type        | Size (bytes) | Description                    |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `Boolean`   | 1           | `False` = 0, `True` = 1       |
| `ByteBool`  | 1           | `False` = 0, `True` = nonzero |
| `WordBool`  | 2           | `False` = 0, `True` = nonzero |
| `LongBool`  | 4           | `False` = 0, `True` = nonzero |

For `Boolean`, the only valid values are 0 (`False`) and 1 (`True`). For `ByteBool`, `WordBool`, and `LongBool`, any nonzero value is `True`, and applying `not` to a `True` value yields `False` (0). These wider boolean types exist for COM/Windows API interoperability.

#### 3.3.4 Enumerated Types

```
ENUM_TYPE = '(' ENUM_ELEMENT { ',' ENUM_ELEMENT } ')' ;
ENUM_ELEMENT = IDENT [ '=' CONST_EXPR ] ;
```

Example:
```pascal
type
  TColor = (clRed, clGreen, clBlue);
  TSuit = (Hearts = 1, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades);  // 1, 2, 3, 4
```

Rules:

1. By default, the first element has ordinal value 0, and each subsequent element has a value one greater than its predecessor.
2. An explicit `= CONST_EXPR` assigns a specific ordinal value. Subsequent elements without explicit values continue incrementing from the specified value.
3. Values need not be contiguous, but each must be greater than the previous. Duplicate values are not permitted.
4. The element identifiers are declared in the scope enclosing the type declaration (not scoped to the type).
5. **Scoped enumerations** (Delphi 2009+): When `{$SCOPEDENUMS ON}` is active, enumeration elements are scoped to their type and must be qualified: `TColor.clRed`. Without this directive, both `clRed` and `TColor.clRed` are valid.
6. The underlying storage size is chosen to accommodate all values: 1 byte if max ≤ 255, 2 bytes if max ≤ 65535, 4 bytes otherwise. The `{$Z}` directive can override minimum storage size.

#### 3.3.5 Subrange Types

```
SUBRANGE_TYPE = CONST_EXPR '..' CONST_EXPR ;
```

Example:
```pascal
type
  TMonth = 1..12;
  TUpperCase = 'A'..'Z';
```

Rules:

1. Both bounds must be constant expressions of the same ordinal type.
2. The lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound.
3. The base type of the subrange is the host type of the bounds.
4. Range checking (`{$R+}`) generates runtime checks for subrange assignments.

### 3.4 Real (Floating-Point) Types

| Type        | Size (bytes) | Significant digits | Range (approximate)        |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| `Single`    | 4           | 7-8                | 1.5e-45 .. 3.4e+38         |
| `Double`    | 8           | 15-16              | 5.0e-324 .. 1.7e+308       |
| `Extended`  | 10 (Win32)  | 19-20              | 3.4e-4932 .. 1.1e+4932     |
|             | 8 (Win64)   | 15-16              | same as `Double`            |
| `Comp`      | 8           | 19-20              | -2^63+1 .. 2^63-1 (integral)|
| `Currency`  | 8           | 19-20              | -922337203685477.5808 ..    |
|             |             |                    | 922337203685477.5807        |
| `Real`      | 8           | 15-16              | same as `Double`            |
| `Real48`    | 6           | 11-12              | 2.9e-39 .. 1.7e+38         |

Notes:

1. `Extended` is 80-bit on Win32 (x87) but maps to `Double` (64-bit) on Win64 and other 64-bit platforms where the x87 80-bit format is not natively supported.
2. `Currency` is a fixed-point type stored as a 64-bit integer with an implicit divisor of 10,000. It is the preferred type for monetary calculations.
3. `Comp` is deprecated. Use `Int64` instead.
4. `Real48` is the old Turbo Pascal 6-byte real format. It is retained for backward compatibility only.
5. `Real` is an alias for `Double`.

### 3.5 String Types

#### 3.5.1 UnicodeString (Default String Type)

`UnicodeString` is the default type for `string` (when `{$H+}` is active, which is the default). It is a **reference-counted**, **copy-on-write**, dynamically allocated string of `WideChar` elements (UTF-16 encoding).

Memory layout:

```
[CodePage: Word][ElemSize: Word][RefCount: Integer][Length: Integer][Char data...][#0#0]
```

- **CodePage** — 1200 for UTF-16.
- **ElemSize** — 2 (bytes per element).
- **RefCount** — reference count for COW semantics. -1 indicates a string constant (never freed).
- **Length** — number of `Char` elements (not bytes, not code points).
- The data is followed by a null `WideChar` for C interoperability.

Indexing is **1-based** by default. `S[1]` is the first character. (With `{$ZEROBASEDSTRINGS ON}`, indexing is 0-based.)

Assignment creates a new reference (increments ref count). Modification triggers copy-on-write if ref count > 1.

#### 3.5.2 AnsiString

`AnsiString` is a reference-counted string of `AnsiChar` elements. It carries a **code page** attribute:

```pascal
type
  UTF8String = AnsiString(65001);
  RawByteString = AnsiString($FFFF);
```

The code page is part of the type's identity at compile time. The runtime performs automatic code page conversion when assigning between `AnsiString` types with different code pages, and when converting to/from `UnicodeString`.

`RawByteString` (code page $FFFF) is a special "no conversion" type: it accepts any `AnsiString` without triggering code page conversion. It should only be used for parameters, never for variables.

#### 3.5.3 ShortString

```
SHORT_STRING_TYPE = 'string' '[' CONST_EXPR ']' ;
```

`ShortString` is a fixed-capacity string stored on the stack (or inline in a record). The maximum length is 255 characters. It is **not** reference counted.

Memory layout:

```
[Length: Byte][Char data: array[1..MaxLen] of AnsiChar]
```

`ShortString` with no length specifier has a maximum length of 255. `string[N]` declares a short string of maximum length `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 255).

When `{$H-}` is active, `string` without a length specifier means `ShortString` (compatibility mode).

#### 3.5.4 WideString

`WideString` is a UTF-16 string type that uses COM BSTR allocation (`SysAllocStringLen`/`SysFreeString`). It is **not** reference counted (each assignment makes a deep copy). It exists primarily for COM interoperability on Windows.

#### 3.5.5 String Operators and Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `+`       | Concatenation |
| `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Lexicographic comparison |
| `S[I]`    | Character access (1-based by default) |
| `Length(S)` | Number of characters |
| `SetLength(S, N)` | Resize string |

### 3.6 Structured Types

#### 3.6.1 Array Types

##### Static Arrays

```
STATIC_ARRAY_TYPE = 'array' '[' INDEX_TYPE { ',' INDEX_TYPE } ']' 'of' BASE_TYPE ;
INDEX_TYPE = ORDINAL_TYPE | SUBRANGE_TYPE ;
```

Example:
```pascal
type
  TMatrix = array[1..10, 1..10] of Double;
  TFlags  = array[Boolean] of string;
```

Static arrays are allocated inline (on the stack for locals, in the data segment for globals, inline in records/classes). Their size is fixed at compile time.

A multi-dimensional array `array[T1, T2] of X` is equivalent to `array[T1] of array[T2] of X`.

##### Dynamic Arrays

```
DYNAMIC_ARRAY_TYPE = 'array' 'of' BASE_TYPE ;
```

Dynamic arrays are **reference-counted**, heap-allocated. They are **0-based** (the first element is index 0). Unlike strings, dynamic arrays do **not** use copy-on-write; assigning one dynamic array variable to another shares the same data.

Memory layout:

```
[RefCount: Integer][Length: Integer][Element data...]
```

Operations:

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `SetLength(A, N)` | Allocate/resize to N elements |
| `Length(A)` | Number of elements |
| `Low(A)` | Always 0 |
| `High(A)` | `Length(A) - 1` (-1 if empty) |
| `A + B` | Array concatenation (Delphi 10.4+) |
| `Copy(A, I, N)` | Shallow copy of N elements starting at I |
| `Insert(Elem, A, I)` | Insert element at position I |
| `Delete(A, I, N)` | Delete N elements starting at I |
| `A := [1,2,3]` | Dynamic array constructor (Delphi XE7+) |

Dynamic arrays support **reference semantics**: assigning one dynamic array variable to another copies the reference (both point to the same data). Use `Copy` for a shallow value copy.

##### Open Array Parameters

An **open array parameter** accepts any array (static or dynamic) of a given element type:

```pascal
procedure Process(const Arr: array of Integer);
```

Within the procedure, `Low(Arr)` is always 0 and `High(Arr)` is `Length - 1`. Open arrays are passed as two hidden values: a pointer to the data and the high bound.

##### Array of Const

```pascal
procedure Format(const Args: array of const);
```

`array of const` is an open array of `TVarRec` records. Each element can hold a value of any type. This is the mechanism underlying `Format`, `WriteLn`, etc.

#### 3.6.2 Record Types

```
RECORD_TYPE = 'record'
              { FIELD_SECTION }
              [ VARIANT_PART ]
              'end' ;

FIELD_SECTION = [ VISIBILITY ] FIELD_LIST ';'
              | METHOD_DECLARATION
              | PROPERTY_DECLARATION
              | CONST_SECTION
              | TYPE_SECTION
              | CLASS_VAR_SECTION
              | OPERATOR_DECLARATION ;

FIELD_LIST = IDENT_LIST ':' TYPE ;

VARIANT_PART = 'case' [ IDENT ':' ] ORDINAL_TYPE 'of'
               VARIANT { ';' VARIANT } [ ';' ] ;
VARIANT = CONST_EXPR_LIST ':' '(' FIELD_LIST { ';' FIELD_LIST } ')' ;
```

Records are **value types**. Assignment copies all fields. Records may contain:

- Fields (including variant parts for overlapping storage)
- Methods (instance and class/static)
- Properties
- Operators (overloaded)
- Nested type and constant declarations
- Class variables (`class var`)
- Constructors (but no destructors — records have no finalizer other than `Finalize` for managed fields)

Records **cannot** inherit from other records and do not support polymorphism. See Chapter 10 for advanced record features.

##### Variant Parts

Variant parts provide **overlapping storage** (like C unions). All variants share the same memory. The tag field (if named) occupies real storage; variants overlap after it.

```pascal
type
  TValue = record
    case Kind: Integer of
      0: (AsInteger: Integer);
      1: (AsDouble: Double);
      2: (AsChar: array[0..7] of Char);
  end;
```

The total size of the record is the size of the fixed fields plus the size of the **largest** variant.

#### 3.6.3 Set Types

```
SET_TYPE = 'set' 'of' ORDINAL_TYPE ;
```

The base ordinal type must have at most 256 values (ordinal range 0..255).

Storage: a bit vector of ⌈(High - Low + 1) / 8⌉ bytes. Bit `N` is set if value `N` is in the set.

Set constructors:

```pascal
var S: set of Byte;
S := [1, 3, 5..10, 20];
S := [];          // empty set
```

Set operators:

| Operator | Operation       |
|----------|-----------------|
| `+`      | Union           |
| `-`      | Difference      |
| `*`      | Intersection    |
| `=`      | Equality        |
| `<>`     | Inequality      |
| `<=`     | Subset          |
| `>=`     | Superset        |
| `in`     | Membership test |
| `Include(S, E)` | Add element (intrinsic procedure) |
| `Exclude(S, E)` | Remove element (intrinsic procedure) |

#### 3.6.4 File Types

```
FILE_TYPE = 'file' 'of' TYPE
          | 'file' ;
```

- **`file of T`** — typed file. `T` must not contain managed types (strings, dynamic arrays, interfaces, variants).
- **`file`** (untyped) — raw byte-level I/O.
- **`TextFile`** / **`Text`** — predefined type for line-oriented text I/O.

File variables shall not be assigned (copied). They must be passed by reference.

### 3.7 Pointer Types

```
POINTER_TYPE = '^' TYPE_IDENT ;
```

Example:
```pascal
type
  PInteger = ^Integer;
  PNode    = ^TNode;
```

Rules:

1. `Pointer` is the generic untyped pointer (like `void*` in C). It is compatible with all pointer types.
2. `nil` is the null pointer constant, compatible with all pointer, class, interface, procedural, and dynamic-array types.
3. The `^` operator dereferences a pointer: `P^` yields the value pointed to by `P`.
4. The `@` operator takes the address of a variable: `@X` yields a pointer to `X`.
5. Pointer arithmetic is supported when `{$POINTERMATH ON}` is active:
   - `P + N` advances the pointer by `N * SizeOf(T)` bytes.
   - `P - N` moves the pointer back.
   - `P - Q` yields the number of elements between two pointers of the same type.
   - Array indexing `P[N]` is equivalent to `(P + N)^`.
6. Forward declarations: a pointer type may reference a type not yet declared in the same `type` block. The forward reference is resolved at the end of the `type` block.

### 3.8 Procedural Types

```
PROC_TYPE   = PROCEDURE_TYPE | FUNCTION_TYPE | METHOD_TYPE_PROC | METHOD_TYPE_FUNC ;

PROCEDURE_TYPE   = 'procedure' [ FORMAL_PARAMS ] [ ';' CALLING_CONV ] ;
FUNCTION_TYPE    = 'function' [ FORMAL_PARAMS ] ':' RETURN_TYPE [ ';' CALLING_CONV ] ;
METHOD_TYPE_PROC = 'procedure' [ FORMAL_PARAMS ] 'of' 'object' [ ';' CALLING_CONV ] ;
METHOD_TYPE_FUNC = 'function' [ FORMAL_PARAMS ] ':' RETURN_TYPE 'of' 'object' [ ';' CALLING_CONV ] ;
```

Three categories:

1. **Procedure/function pointers** — point to standalone procedures/functions.
2. **Method pointers** (`of object`) — point to a method bound to a specific object instance. Stored as a pair: (code pointer, data/object pointer).
3. **Method references** (`reference to`) — see Chapter 12.

A procedural type variable can hold `nil`.

Example:
```pascal
type
  TNotifyEvent = procedure(Sender: TObject) of object;
  TCompareFunc = function(const A, B: Integer): Integer;
  TProc        = reference to procedure;
```

### 3.9 Variant Type

The `Variant` type can hold values of many different types at runtime. Variants are used for COM Automation and late-binding scenarios.

Internal layout: `TVarData` record (16 bytes), containing a type code (`VType: Word`) and a data area.

Supported types: all ordinal types, real types, `Currency`, `string`, `Boolean`, `IDispatch`, `IUnknown`, `OleVariant`, arrays of `Variant`, and `nil` (`Unassigned` / `Null`).

Operations on variants are resolved at **runtime** using type coercion rules. If a coercion is not possible, an `EVariantError` exception is raised.

`OleVariant` is a variant type restricted to OLE-compatible types (no `AnsiString`, no custom types). It is used for COM interop.

### 3.10 Type Aliases and Distinct Types

```pascal
type
  TMyInt = Integer;            // type alias — identical to Integer
  TMyDistinct = type Integer;  // distinct type — new RTTI, compatible but not identical
```

A type alias creates an alternative name for an existing type. The alias and the original are the **same type** for all purposes.

A `type T` declaration creates a **distinct type** that:
- Has its own RTTI
- Is assignment-compatible with the base type
- Is NOT identical to the base type (affects overload resolution, generic constraints)

### 3.11 Type Helpers

```
TYPE_HELPER = 'type' 'helper' [ '(' PARENT_HELPER ')' ] 'for' SIMPLE_TYPE
              { MEMBER_DECLARATION }
              'end' ;
```

Type helpers extend simple types (integers, floats, strings, enums, sets) with methods and properties without subclassing:

```pascal
type
  TIntHelper = record helper for Integer
    function ToString: string;
    function InRange(Low, High: Integer): Boolean;
  end;
```

Rules:

1. Only **one** helper per type can be active in a given scope. If multiple helpers for the same type are in scope, the last one (in `uses` order) wins.
2. Helpers can extend any named simple type, record type, class type, or enumerated type.
3. Helper methods receive `Self` as an implicit parameter (by value for value types, by reference for class types).

---

## Chapter 4: Declarations

### 4.1 Declaration Order

Within a block, declaration sections may appear in any order and may be repeated:

```
DECLARATION_SECTION = LABEL_SECTION
                    | CONST_SECTION
                    | TYPE_SECTION
                    | VAR_SECTION
                    | THREADVAR_SECTION
                    | PROCEDURE_DECLARATION
                    | FUNCTION_DECLARATION ;
```

There is no required ordering (unlike original Pascal which required `label`, `const`, `type`, `var`, then procedures).

### 4.2 Label Declarations

```
LABEL_SECTION = 'label' LABEL { ',' LABEL } ';' ;
LABEL = IDENT | INTEGER_LITERAL ;
```

Labels are targets for `goto` statements. Their use is strongly discouraged. Labels must be declared in the same block that contains the `goto` and the labeled statement.

### 4.3 Constant Declarations

#### 4.3.1 True Constants

```
CONST_DECL = IDENT [ ':' TYPE ] '=' CONST_EXPR ';' ;
```

When no type is given, the constant's type is inferred from the expression. A typed constant with a simple type is a true compile-time constant.

```pascal
const
  Pi = 3.14159265358979;          // inferred as Extended
  MaxItems: Integer = 100;        // typed constant (see §4.3.2)
  AppName = 'MyApp';              // inferred as string
  Flags = [fsReadOnly, fsHidden]; // inferred as set
```

#### 4.3.2 Typed Constants (Initialized Variables)

When `{$J+}` (default off in modern Delphi) or `{$WRITEABLECONST ON}` is active, typed constants are **writable** — they are actually initialized global variables that persist across calls.

When `{$J-}` (the default), typed constants are **read-only** after initialization.

Typed constants of structured types (arrays, records) use aggregate constant syntax:

```pascal
const
  Origin: TPoint = (X: 0; Y: 0);
  Primes: array[0..4] of Integer = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11);
```

#### 4.3.3 Resource Strings

```
RESOURCESTRING_SECTION = 'resourcestring' { IDENT '=' STRING_CONST ';' } ;
```

Resource strings are string constants that are stored in the executable's resource section and can be localized. They are of type `string` and are read-only.

### 4.4 Type Declarations

```
TYPE_SECTION = 'type' { TYPE_DECL } ;
TYPE_DECL    = IDENT [ GENERIC_PARAMS ] '=' [ 'type' ] TYPE [ PORTABILITY_DIRECTIVE ] ';' ;
```

Forward declarations for classes and interfaces are permitted:

```pascal
type
  TNode = class;   // forward declaration
  PNode = ^TNode;
  TNode = class    // full declaration
    Next: PNode;
  end;
```

A forward declaration must be resolved within the same `type` block.

### 4.5 Variable Declarations

```
VAR_SECTION = 'var' { VAR_DECL } ;
VAR_DECL    = IDENT_LIST ':' TYPE [ '=' INITIAL_VALUE ] [ PORTABILITY_DIRECTIVE ] ';'
            | IDENT_LIST ':' TYPE ABSOLUTE_CLAUSE ';' ;
```

#### 4.5.1 Initialization

- **Global variables** are zero-initialized by default.
- **Local variables** of unmanaged types are **not initialized** — their initial value is undefined.
- **Local variables** of managed types (strings, dynamic arrays, interfaces, variants) are initialized to their "empty" state (`''`, `nil`, `Unassigned`).
- **Class fields** are zero-initialized when the object is created.

#### 4.5.2 The `absolute` Directive

```
ABSOLUTE_CLAUSE = 'absolute' ( IDENT | CONST_EXPR ) ;
```

`absolute` overlays a variable at the same memory address as another variable:

```pascal
var
  L: LongInt;
  B: array[0..3] of Byte absolute L;  // B overlays L
```

#### 4.5.3 Inline Variable Declarations (Delphi 10.3+)

Variables may be declared at the point of first use within a `begin..end` block:

```pascal
begin
  var X := 42;                    // type inferred as Integer
  var Name: string := 'Hello';    // explicit type
  for var I := 0 to 10 do         // loop variable declaration
    WriteLn(I);
end;
```

Rules:

1. The scope of an inline variable extends from its declaration to the end of the innermost enclosing block.
2. Type inference uses the same rules as `const` inference.
3. Inline variables of managed types are finalized when they go out of scope.

### 4.6 Thread-Local Variables

```
THREADVAR_SECTION = 'threadvar' { VAR_DECL } ;
```

`threadvar` declares variables with thread-local storage. Each thread gets its own copy. Thread-local variables are zero-initialized for each new thread.

Restrictions:

- Cannot have initializers.
- Cannot be of a type that requires initialization (classes are OK as pointers, but interfaces and variants are problematic — implementation-defined).

### 4.7 Portability Directives

Declarations may be annotated with portability directives:

| Directive      | Meaning                                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `platform`     | Platform-specific; may not exist on all targets |
| `deprecated`   | Deprecated; usage generates a warning           |
| `deprecated 'msg'` | Deprecated with custom message             |
| `experimental` | Experimental; may change or be removed          |
| `library`      | Specific to library (DLL) usage                 |

## Chapter 5: Expressions

### 5.1 Expression Overview

An expression computes a value. Expressions are composed of **operands** (literals, constants, variables, function calls) combined with **operators**.

```
EXPRESSION = SIMPLE_EXPR [ REL_OP SIMPLE_EXPR ] ;
SIMPLE_EXPR = [ '+' | '-' ] TERM { ADD_OP TERM } ;
TERM = FACTOR { MUL_OP FACTOR } ;
FACTOR = DESIGNATOR [ '(' EXPR_LIST ')' ]
       | '@' DESIGNATOR
       | NUMBER
       | STRING_LITERAL
       | 'nil'
       | 'not' FACTOR
       | '(' EXPRESSION ')'
       | SET_CONSTRUCTOR
       | INHERITED_EXPR
       | VALUE_TYPE_CONSTRUCTOR ;
```

### 5.2 Operator Precedence

Operators are listed from highest to lowest precedence:

| Precedence | Operators                        | Category            |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 (highest)| `@`, `not`                       | Unary               |
| 2          | `*`, `/`, `div`, `mod`, `and`, `shl`, `shr`, `as` | Multiplicative |
| 3          | `+`, `-`, `or`, `xor`           | Additive            |
| 4 (lowest) | `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `in`, `is` | Relational |

All binary operators at the same precedence level are **left-associative**.

**Important:** Unlike C-family languages, `and` and `or` have **higher** precedence than relational operators. This means:

```pascal
if A > 0 and B > 0 then  // WRONG: parsed as A > (0 and B) > 0
if (A > 0) and (B > 0) then  // CORRECT
```

### 5.3 Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Operation          | Operand Types        | Result Type       |
|----------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `+`      | Addition           | Integer, Real        | Integer or Real   |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | Integer, Real        | Integer or Real   |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | Integer, Real        | Integer or Real   |
| `/`      | Real division      | Integer, Real        | Real (always)     |
| `div`    | Integer division   | Integer              | Integer           |
| `mod`    | Modulus            | Integer              | Integer           |
| `+`      | Unary plus         | Integer, Real        | same              |
| `-`      | Unary negation     | Integer, Real        | same              |

**Type promotion rules for mixed arithmetic:**

1. If both operands are integer types, the result is the common type (the smallest type that encompasses both).
2. If either operand is a real type, the other is promoted to `Extended` (or `Double` on 64-bit), and the result is `Extended` (or `Double`).
3. `/` always produces a real result, even with integer operands.
4. `div` truncates toward zero: `7 div 2 = 3`, `-7 div 2 = -3`.
5. `mod` is defined such that `A mod B = A - (A div B) * B`. The sign of the result matches the sign of `A`.

**Overflow behavior:**

- With `{$Q+}` (overflow checking), signed integer overflow raises `EIntOverflow`.
- With `{$Q-}` (the default), signed integer overflow wraps (two's complement).
- Unsigned integer overflow always wraps.

### 5.4 Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Operation          | Operand Types | Result Type |
|----------|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `not`    | Bitwise complement | Integer       | same        |
| `and`    | Bitwise AND        | Integer       | Integer     |
| `or`     | Bitwise OR         | Integer       | Integer     |
| `xor`    | Bitwise XOR        | Integer       | Integer     |
| `shl`    | Shift left         | Integer       | Integer     |
| `shr`    | Shift right        | Integer       | Integer     |

`shr` performs **logical** (unsigned) shift for unsigned types and **arithmetic** (sign-extending) shift for signed types.

### 5.5 Boolean Operators

When applied to `Boolean` operands, `and`, `or`, `xor`, and `not` perform logical operations:

| Operator | Operation   |
|----------|-------------|
| `not`    | Logical NOT |
| `and`    | Logical AND |
| `or`     | Logical OR  |
| `xor`    | Logical XOR |

**Short-circuit evaluation:**

- With `{$B-}` (the default), `and` and `or` use **short-circuit** evaluation: the second operand is not evaluated if the result is determined by the first.
  - `A and B`: if `A` is `False`, `B` is not evaluated.
  - `A or B`: if `A` is `True`, `B` is not evaluated.
- With `{$B+}`, both operands are always evaluated (**complete evaluation**).

### 5.6 String Operators

| Operator | Operation      | Operand Types    | Result Type |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| `+`      | Concatenation  | String, Char     | String      |
| `=`      | Equal          | String, Char     | Boolean     |
| `<>`     | Not equal      | String, Char     | Boolean     |
| `<`      | Less than      | String, Char     | Boolean     |
| `>`      | Greater than   | String, Char     | Boolean     |
| `<=`     | Less or equal  | String, Char     | Boolean     |
| `>=`     | Greater or equal | String, Char   | Boolean     |

String comparison is **ordinal** (compares character code points left to right). It is **case-sensitive**. For case-insensitive comparison, use runtime functions like `SameText` or `CompareText`.

### 5.7 Set Operators

| Operator | Operation       | Operand Types | Result Type |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| `+`      | Union           | Set           | Set         |
| `-`      | Difference      | Set           | Set         |
| `*`      | Intersection    | Set           | Set         |
| `=`      | Equal           | Set           | Boolean     |
| `<>`     | Not equal       | Set           | Boolean     |
| `<=`     | Subset          | Set           | Boolean     |
| `>=`     | Superset        | Set           | Boolean     |
| `in`     | Membership      | Ordinal, Set  | Boolean     |

A **set constructor** builds a set value:

```
SET_CONSTRUCTOR = '[' [ SET_ELEMENT { ',' SET_ELEMENT } ] ']' ;
SET_ELEMENT = EXPRESSION [ '..' EXPRESSION ] ;
```

### 5.8 Relational Operators

| Operator | Operation            | Result |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| `=`      | Equal                | Boolean |
| `<>`     | Not equal            | Boolean |
| `<`      | Less than            | Boolean |
| `>`      | Greater than         | Boolean |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | Boolean |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | Boolean |
| `is`     | Type test            | Boolean |
| `in`     | Set membership       | Boolean |

#### 5.8.1 The `is` Operator

```pascal
if Obj is TMyClass then ...
```

`is` tests whether an object is an instance of a given class or its descendants. The left operand must be a class-type expression; the right must be a class type. Returns `True` if the object's actual (runtime) class is the specified class or a descendant of it.

`is` can also test interface support:

```pascal
if Obj is IMyInterface then ...
```

#### 5.8.2 The `as` Operator

```pascal
var MyObj := Obj as TMyClass;
```

`as` performs a **checked typecast**. If the object is not an instance of the specified class (or does not support the specified interface), an `EInvalidCast` exception is raised.

For interfaces:

```pascal
var Intf := Obj as IMyInterface;
```

This calls `QueryInterface` internally and raises `EIntfCastError` on failure.

### 5.9 The Address-of Operator (`@`)

```pascal
var P: Pointer;
P := @MyVariable;
```

- `@Variable` returns a `Pointer` (when `{$T-}`, the default) or a typed pointer `^T` (when `{$T+}`).
- `@Procedure` returns a pointer to the procedure's code.
- `@Object.Method` returns a method code pointer (not a method pointer pair; for that, use a method pointer type assignment).

### 5.10 The Dereference Operator (`^`)

```pascal
var P: ^Integer;
P^ := 42;  // dereference: access the Integer pointed to by P
```

### 5.11 Designators and Member Access

```
DESIGNATOR = IDENT { DESIGNATOR_PART } ;
DESIGNATOR_PART = '.' IDENT           (* member access *)
                | '[' EXPR_LIST ']'   (* array indexing *)
                | '^'                 (* pointer dereference *)
                | '(' EXPR_LIST ')'   (* function call / type cast *) ;
```

Examples:
```pascal
A[I]            // array index
P^              // dereference
Obj.Field       // member access
Obj.Method(X)   // method call
TMyClass(Obj)   // type cast
```

### 5.12 Type Casting

#### 5.12.1 Value Typecasts

```pascal
Integer(MyChar)    // convert Char to Integer (ordinal value)
Byte(MyInteger)    // truncate Integer to Byte
```

Value typecasts convert between types of the same size, or between ordinal types. The compiler may generate conversion code or simply reinterpret the bit pattern.

Rules:
1. Both the source and target must be ordinal types, pointer types, or types of the same size.
2. No runtime check is performed.

#### 5.12.2 Variable Typecasts (Hard Casts)

```pascal
TMyRec(MyPointer^)   // reinterpret memory at pointer as TMyRec
```

A variable typecast reinterprets a variable's memory as a different type. The source must be a variable reference (not a value). The cast produces an **lvalue** — it can appear on the left side of an assignment.

#### 5.12.3 Checked Casts (`as`)

See §5.8.2. The `as` operator performs runtime type checking and raises an exception on failure.

### 5.13 Constant Expressions

A **constant expression** is an expression that can be evaluated at compile time. Constant expressions are required in:

- Array bounds
- Case labels
- Constant declarations
- Enum values
- Default parameter values

Constant expressions may include:
- Numeric, string, and boolean literals
- Previously declared constants
- Arithmetic, logical, and relational operators
- Intrinsics: `Ord`, `Chr`, `Pred`, `Succ`, `High`, `Low`, `SizeOf`, `Length` (for static arrays and strings), `Abs`, `Round`, `Trunc`, `Odd`, `Lo`, `Hi`, `Swap`
- Typecast of constant values
- String concatenation

Constant expressions shall **not** include:
- Variable references
- Function calls (other than the intrinsics listed above)
- Pointer operations
- `@` operator

### 5.14 Inline Expressions and Compiler Intrinsics

The compiler recognizes certain function-like constructs as intrinsics that are expanded inline:

| Intrinsic        | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `SizeOf(T)`      | Size of type T in bytes                             |
| `TypeInfo(T)`    | Pointer to RTTI for type T                          |
| `TypeOf(T)`      | Returns class reference for a class type            |
| `IsManagedType(T)` | True if T is a managed type                      |
| `HasWeakRef(T)`  | True if T supports weak references                  |
| `GetTypeKind(T)` | Returns the TTypeKind for T (resolved at compile time) |
| `IsConstValue(X)` | True if X is a compile-time constant               |
| `Assigned(P)`    | True if P is not nil (pointer, object, proc)        |
| `Default(T)`     | Default (zero) value of type T                      |
| `Assert(Cond [, Msg])` | Debug assertion                               |
| `Inc(X [, N])`   | Increment ordinal or pointer                        |
| `Dec(X [, N])`   | Decrement ordinal or pointer                        |
| `Include(S, E)`  | Add element to set                                  |
| `Exclude(S, E)`  | Remove element from set                             |
| `Swap(X)`        | Swap bytes of a Word value                          |
| `Lo(X)`          | Low byte of a word/integer                          |
| `Hi(X)`          | High byte of a word/integer                         |

## Chapter 6: Statements

### 6.1 Statement Grammar

```
STATEMENT = [ LABEL ':' ] ( SIMPLE_STMT | STRUCTURED_STMT ) ;

SIMPLE_STMT = ASSIGNMENT_STMT
            | PROCEDURE_CALL
            | GOTO_STMT
            | INHERITED_STMT
            | RAISE_STMT
            | (* empty statement *) ;

STRUCTURED_STMT = COMPOUND_STMT
                | CONDITIONAL_STMT
                | LOOP_STMT
                | WITH_STMT
                | TRY_STMT
                | ASM_STMT ;
```

### 6.2 Assignment Statement

```
ASSIGNMENT_STMT = DESIGNATOR ':=' EXPRESSION ;
```

The expression's type must be assignment-compatible with the designator's type. The designator must be an **lvalue** (a writable variable, field, array element, pointer dereference, or property with a setter).

For **function results**, the function name or the implicit variable `Result` serves as the lvalue:

```pascal
function Add(A, B: Integer): Integer;
begin
  Result := A + B;    // using Result
  // or: Add := A + B;  // using function name (older style)
end;
```

### 6.3 Procedure and Function Calls

```
PROCEDURE_CALL = DESIGNATOR [ '(' EXPR_LIST ')' ] ;
```

Parentheses may be omitted if the procedure/function takes no parameters.

### 6.4 Compound Statement

```
COMPOUND_STMT = 'begin' STMT_LIST 'end' ;
STMT_LIST     = [ STATEMENT { ';' STATEMENT } ] ;
```

### 6.5 The `if` Statement

```
IF_STMT = 'if' EXPRESSION 'then' STATEMENT
          [ 'else' STATEMENT ] ;
```

The expression must be of type `Boolean`. The `else` clause binds to the nearest unmatched `if` (dangling else resolved by nearest match).

### 6.6 The `case` Statement

```
CASE_STMT = 'case' EXPRESSION 'of'
            CASE_SELECTOR { ';' CASE_SELECTOR }
            [ ';' ] [ 'else' STMT_LIST [ ';' ] ]
            'end' ;

CASE_SELECTOR = CASE_LABEL_LIST ':' STATEMENT ;
CASE_LABEL_LIST = CASE_LABEL { ',' CASE_LABEL } ;
CASE_LABEL = CONST_EXPR [ '..' CONST_EXPR ] ;
```

Rules:

1. The selector expression must be of an ordinal type or a string type (Delphi 2009+).
2. For ordinal selectors, each case label must be a constant expression of a compatible ordinal type.
3. For string selectors, each case label must be a string constant. Comparison is case-sensitive.
4. No two case labels may have the same value. Ranges must not overlap.
5. If the selector matches no label, the `else` clause executes (if present). If no `else` and no match, execution continues after `end`.
6. Unlike C, there is no fall-through between cases.

### 6.7 The `for` Statement

```
FOR_STMT = 'for' IDENT ':=' EXPRESSION ( 'to' | 'downto' ) EXPRESSION 'do'
           STATEMENT ;
```

Rules:

1. The control variable must be a local variable of an ordinal type.
2. The initial and final values are evaluated **once** before the loop begins.
3. `to` increments the control variable; `downto` decrements it.
4. If the initial value exceeds the final value (for `to`) or is less (for `downto`), the loop body does not execute.
5. The control variable is **undefined** after the loop terminates normally.
6. The loop body shall not modify the control variable.
7. The control variable may be declared inline: `for var I := 0 to 10 do ...`

#### 6.7.1 The `for..in` Statement

```
FOR_IN_STMT = 'for' IDENT 'in' EXPRESSION 'do' STATEMENT ;
```

`for..in` iterates over:

1. **Arrays** (static and dynamic): iterates over elements.
2. **Strings**: iterates over characters.
3. **Sets**: iterates over members.
4. **Collections** with enumerator support: any type that provides a `GetEnumerator` method.

The enumerator protocol requires:

```pascal
type
  TMyEnumerator = class
    function MoveNext: Boolean;
    property Current: T read GetCurrent;
  end;

  TMyCollection = class
    function GetEnumerator: TMyEnumerator;
  end;
```

The `for..in` loop desugars to:

```pascal
var Enum := Collection.GetEnumerator;
try
  while Enum.MoveNext do
  begin
    var Item := Enum.Current;
    // loop body
  end;
finally
  Enum.Free;  // only for class-type enumerators
end;
```

### 6.8 The `while` Statement

```
WHILE_STMT = 'while' EXPRESSION 'do' STATEMENT ;
```

The expression must be `Boolean`. The statement executes repeatedly as long as the expression is `True`. If the expression is initially `False`, the body never executes.

### 6.9 The `repeat..until` Statement

```
REPEAT_STMT = 'repeat' STMT_LIST 'until' EXPRESSION ;
```

The statement list executes at least once. After each iteration, the expression is evaluated; if `True`, the loop terminates. Note: this is the opposite of `while` — the loop continues while the condition is `False`.

### 6.10 The `goto` Statement

```
GOTO_STMT = 'goto' LABEL ;
```

Jumps to the labeled statement. The label and the `goto` must be in the same block (procedure/function body). Jumping into or out of `try..finally` or `try..except` blocks is not permitted and results in undefined behavior.

### 6.11 The `Break` and `Continue` Intrinsics

- `Break` — exits the innermost enclosing `for`, `while`, or `repeat` loop.
- `Continue` — skips to the next iteration of the innermost loop.

These are compiler intrinsics, not true statements, though they are used in statement position.

### 6.12 The `Exit` Intrinsic

```pascal
Exit;              // exits the current procedure/function
Exit(Value);       // exits and sets Result (Delphi 2009+)
```

`Exit` without a parameter exits the current routine. `Exit(Value)` is equivalent to `Result := Value; Exit;` for functions.

### 6.13 The `Halt` and `RunError` Intrinsics

- `Halt [ ( ExitCode ) ]` — terminates the program with the given exit code (default 0).
- `RunError [ ( ErrorCode ) ]` — terminates with a runtime error.

### 6.14 The `with` Statement

```
WITH_STMT = 'with' DESIGNATOR_LIST 'do' STATEMENT ;
DESIGNATOR_LIST = DESIGNATOR { ',' DESIGNATOR } ;
```

`with` adds the fields/members of one or more records, objects, or classes to the current scope:

```pascal
with MyPoint do
begin
  X := 10;  // equivalent to MyPoint.X := 10
  Y := 20;
end;
```

Multiple designators are processed left to right; later ones take precedence:

```pascal
with A, B do   // equivalent to: with A do with B do
  Foo;         // B.Foo takes precedence over A.Foo
```

**Caution:** `with` can cause subtle bugs when the type of the designator changes (e.g., a field is added or renamed). Many style guides discourage its use. The compiler shall generate the same code with or without `with`.

### 6.15 The `raise` Statement

See Chapter 13 (Exception Handling).

### 6.16 The `try` Statement

See Chapter 13 (Exception Handling).

### 6.17 The `asm` Statement

See Chapter 16 (Inline Assembly).

| Modifier     | Semantics                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *(none)*    | **Value**: a copy is made. Modifications do not affect the caller.        |
| `var`       | **Reference**: the parameter is an alias for the caller's variable. The caller must provide an lvalue. |
| `const`     | **Constant reference**: the parameter may be passed by value or by reference (implementation choice for efficiency). The callee shall not modify it. |
| `out`       | **Output**: like `var`, but the initial value is undefined. For managed types, the runtime initializes the parameter to its default value on entry. |
| `[ref]`     | **Explicit reference**: always passed by reference, even for types that would normally be passed by value. (Delphi 10.1+) |
| `const [ref]` | **Constant explicit reference**: combination of `const` and `[ref]`. Always by reference, not modifiable. |

#### 7.2.2 Default Parameter Values

```pascal
procedure Log(const Msg: string; Level: Integer = 0);
```

Rules:
1. Parameters with defaults must appear after all parameters without defaults.
2. The default value must be a constant expression.
3. When calling, trailing defaulted parameters may be omitted.

#### 7.2.3 Open Array Parameters

```pascal
procedure Sum(const Values: array of Integer);
```

See §3.6.1.

#### 7.2.4 Untyped Parameters

`var`, `const`, and `out` parameters may omit the type:

```pascal
procedure Move(const Source; var Dest; Count: NativeInt);
```

Untyped parameters accept any variable. Inside the routine, they must be typecast before use.

### 7.3 Function Return Values

The return type of a function is specified after the parameter list:

```pascal
function Add(A, B: Integer): Integer;
```

The return value is set by assigning to `Result` (the implicit local variable) or to the function name. `Result` is of the declared return type.

For managed types, `Result` is initialized to its default value on entry. For unmanaged types, `Result` is uninitialized.

### 7.4 Overloading

```pascal
procedure Show(X: Integer); overload;
procedure Show(X: string); overload;
```

Multiple routines with the same name may coexist in the same scope if they have the **`overload`** directive and their parameter lists are distinguishable.

#### 7.4.1 Overload Resolution

When a call to an overloaded routine is encountered, the compiler selects the best match:

1. **Exact match**: parameter types exactly match argument types.
2. **Compatible match**: argument types are assignment-compatible with parameter types but require implicit conversion.
3. **Most specific match**: among compatible candidates, the one requiring the least "widening" conversions.

If no single best match exists (ambiguity), a compile-time error is issued. See Appendix E for full resolution rules.

### 7.5 Forward Declarations

```pascal
procedure Foo(X: Integer); forward;
// ... intervening declarations ...
procedure Foo(X: Integer);
begin
  // body
end;
```

A `forward` declaration separates the header from the body. The body must appear later in the **same** declaration section. The parameter list in the body may be omitted if it matches the forward declaration.

### 7.6 External Declarations

```pascal
function MessageBox(Wnd: HWND; Text, Caption: PChar; Flags: Cardinal): Integer;
  stdcall; external 'user32.dll' name 'MessageBoxW';
```

```
EXTERNAL_DIRECTIVE = 'external' [ STRING_LITERAL ]
                     [ 'name' STRING_LITERAL | 'index' INTEGER_LITERAL ]
                     [ 'delayed' ] ;
```

- **`external 'lib'`** — the routine is implemented in an external DLL/shared library.
- **`name 'ExportName'`** — specifies the exported name (for name mangling differences).
- **`index N`** — specifies the export ordinal.
- **`delayed`** — the DLL is loaded on first call (delay-loaded), not at program startup. If the DLL is not found, `EExternalException` is raised at call time.

### 7.7 Inline Expansion

```pascal
function Max(A, B: Integer): Integer; inline;
begin
  if A > B then Result := A else Result := B;
end;
```

The `inline` directive requests that the compiler expand the routine's body at each call site instead of generating a procedure call. The compiler may ignore this request for complex routines.

Rules:
1. `inline` routines must be fully defined in the interface section (the body must be visible to callers).
2. Recursive routines cannot be inlined.
3. Routines containing inline assembly cannot be inlined.

### 7.8 Nested Routines

Procedures and functions may be nested inside other routines:

```pascal
procedure Outer;
  procedure Inner;
  begin
    // can access Outer's local variables
  end;
begin
  Inner;
end;
```

Nested routines can access the local variables and parameters of all enclosing routines. This is implemented via a **frame pointer chain**: each nested routine receives a hidden pointer to the enclosing routine's stack frame.

### 7.9 Routine Directives Summary

| Directive      | Meaning                                                    |

| `varargs`      | C-style variadic arguments (with `cdecl`)                  |
| `static`       | Class method that doesn't receive Self                     |
| `virtual`      | Virtual dispatch                                           |
| `dynamic`      | Dynamic dispatch (smaller VMT, slower call)                |
| `abstract`     | No implementation (must be overridden)                     |
| `override`     | Override an inherited virtual/dynamic method                |
| `reintroduce`  | Hides an inherited method (suppresses warning)             |
| `overload`     | Participates in overload resolution                        |
| `message`      | Message handler                                            |
| `final`        | Prevents further overriding                                |

## Chapter 8: Classes

### 8.1 Class Declaration

```
CLASS_TYPE = 'class' [ ABSTRACT_OR_SEALED ] [ CLASS_HERITAGE ]
             { CLASS_MEMBER_SECTION }
             'end' ;

ABSTRACT_OR_SEALED = 'abstract' | 'sealed' ;

CLASS_HERITAGE = '(' TYPE_REF { ',' TYPE_REF } ')' ;
(* First TYPE_REF is the ancestor class; subsequent ones are interfaces *)

CLASS_MEMBER_SECTION = [ VISIBILITY ]
                       { FIELD_DECLARATION
                       | METHOD_DECLARATION
                       | PROPERTY_DECLARATION
                       | CONST_DECLARATION
                       | TYPE_DECLARATION
                       | CLASS_VAR_SECTION
                       | CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR_DECLARATION
                       | CLASS_DESTRUCTOR_DECLARATION } ;

VISIBILITY = 'public' | 'private' | 'protected' | 'published'
           | 'strict' 'private' | 'strict' 'protected' ;
```

A **forward declaration** of a class provides just the class name:

```pascal
type
  TNode = class;  // forward
```

### 8.2 Class Heritage and Inheritance

Every class inherits from exactly one ancestor class. If no ancestor is specified, the implicit ancestor is `TObject` (defined in the `System` unit).

```pascal
type
  TAnimal = class           // inherits from TObject
  end;
  TDog = class(TAnimal)     // inherits from TAnimal
  end;
```

Object Pascal supports **single inheritance** for classes. Multiple interfaces may be implemented (see Chapter 9).

#### 8.2.1 `abstract` and `sealed` Classes

- **`abstract`** class: cannot be instantiated directly. It may contain abstract methods.
- **`sealed`** class: cannot be subclassed (no class may inherit from it).

```pascal
type
  TShape = class abstract
    function Area: Double; virtual; abstract;
  end;
  TFinalRecord = class sealed
    // ...
  end;
```

### 8.3 Visibility Specifiers

| Visibility        | Access                                                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `public`          | Accessible from anywhere                                       |
| `private`         | Accessible only within the declaring unit                      |
| `protected`       | Accessible within the declaring unit and in descendant classes |
| `published`       | Like `public`, but generates RTTI for the member               |
| `strict private`  | Accessible only within the declaring class (not unit-wide)     |
| `strict protected`| Accessible only within the declaring class and descendants     |
| `automated`       | Legacy (COM Automation); like `public` with Automation RTTI    |

**Default visibility:** If no visibility specifier precedes the first members, they are:
- `published` if the class has `{$M+}` or descends from `TPersistent` (which has `{$M+}`)
- `public` otherwise

### 8.4 Fields

```
FIELD_DECLARATION = IDENT_LIST ':' TYPE ';' ;
```

Fields are stored inline in the object's memory layout. Fields are laid out in declaration order, respecting alignment rules (see §8.18).

#### 8.4.1 Class Fields (`class var`)

```pascal
class var InstanceCount: Integer;
```

Class variables are shared among all instances (like static fields in other languages). They reside in global memory, not in object instances.

### 8.5 Methods

```
METHOD_DECLARATION = METHOD_HEADER ';' [ DIRECTIVE_LIST ';' ] [ METHOD_BODY ';' ] ;
METHOD_HEADER = ( 'procedure' | 'function' | 'constructor' | 'destructor' )
                [ 'class' ] IDENT [ GENERIC_PARAMS ] [ FORMAL_PARAMS ]
                [ ':' RETURN_TYPE ] ;
```

Method bodies in the implementation section use a qualified name:

```pascal
procedure TMyClass.DoSomething;
begin
  // ...
end;
```

#### 8.5.1 Instance Methods

Instance methods receive an implicit `Self` parameter pointing to the object instance. Within a method, `Self` refers to the calling object.

#### 8.5.2 Class Methods

```pascal
class function TMyClass.Create: TMyClass;
```

Class methods receive the class reference (metaclass) as `Self` instead of an instance pointer. They can be called on a class or an instance.

#### 8.5.3 Static Class Methods

```pascal
class function TMyClass.ClassName: string; static;
```

Static class methods receive **no** `Self` parameter. They cannot access instance members or be virtual. They are essentially namespaced standalone functions.

### 8.6 Constructors

```pascal
constructor Create;
constructor Create(const Name: string); overload;
```

Rules:

1. A constructor allocates and initializes an object instance when called on a **class reference** (`TMyClass.Create`). When called on an **instance** (`Self.Create` or `inherited Create`), it does not allocate — it only initializes.
2. **Allocation**: When called on a class reference, the constructor:
   a. Calls `NewInstance` (which calls `InstanceSize` and allocates memory).
   b. Zero-fills the instance memory.
   c. Sets the object's class pointer (first field in the VMT layout).
   d. Executes the constructor body.
   e. Calls `AfterConstruction`.
3. **Exception safety**: If an exception occurs during the constructor body, `Destroy` is called automatically and the memory is freed.
4. Constructors can be `virtual`. When called through a class-reference variable (`TClass.Create`), the actual constructor dispatched depends on the runtime class.

### 8.7 Destructors

```pascal
destructor Destroy; override;
```

Rules:

1. By convention, the destructor is named `Destroy` and overrides `TObject.Destroy`.
2. `Free` (defined on `TObject`) checks for `nil` before calling `Destroy`.
3. Destructor execution:
   a. `BeforeDestruction` is called.
   b. The destructor body executes.
   c. `inherited` propagates up the chain.
   d. `FreeInstance` deallocates the memory.
4. Destructors should be tolerant of partially constructed objects (fields may be zero/nil if the constructor didn't complete).

### 8.8 Virtual Methods and Polymorphism

#### 8.8.1 The `virtual` Directive

```pascal
procedure Draw; virtual;
```

A `virtual` method is dispatched through the **Virtual Method Table (VMT)**. Each class has its own VMT containing pointers to its method implementations.

#### 8.8.2 The `dynamic` Directive

```pascal
procedure WndProc(var Message: TMessage); dynamic;
```

`dynamic` is semantically identical to `virtual` but uses a different dispatch mechanism: a compact message-map instead of a full VMT slot. This saves memory when many classes override few methods, but dispatch is slower (linear search). `dynamic` is primarily used for Windows message handlers.

#### 8.8.3 The `override` Directive

```pascal
procedure Draw; override;
```

`override` replaces the inherited virtual/dynamic method's entry in the VMT. The method signature must exactly match the inherited method (same name, same parameters, same return type, same calling convention).

#### 8.8.4 The `final` Directive

```pascal
procedure Draw; override; final;
```

`final` prevents descendants from further overriding the method. Attempting to override a `final` method is a compile-time error.

#### 8.8.5 Abstract Methods

```pascal
function Area: Double; virtual; abstract;
```

An abstract method has no implementation in the declaring class. Subclasses must override it. Calling an abstract method at runtime (if not overridden) raises `EAbstractError`.

#### 8.8.6 The `reintroduce` Directive

```pascal
procedure Draw; reintroduce;
```

`reintroduce` suppresses the compiler warning that occurs when a method in a descendant class has the same name as an inherited virtual method but does not override it. The new method **hides** (rather than overrides) the inherited one.

### 8.9 The `inherited` Keyword

```pascal
inherited;                    // call inherited method with same parameters
inherited MethodName(Args);   // call specific inherited method
inherited Create(Args);       // call inherited constructor
```

`inherited` without a method name calls the inherited method of the same name, passing the same parameters. `inherited` with a name calls the specified inherited method.

If the current class has no inherited method of that name, `inherited` does nothing (no error) in the no-argument form.

### 8.10 Properties

```
PROPERTY_DECLARATION = [ 'class' ] 'property' IDENT [ PROPERTY_INTERFACE ]
                       { PROPERTY_SPECIFIER } ';'
                       [ DEFAULT_DIRECTIVE ';' ] ;

PROPERTY_INTERFACE = [ '[' PARAM_LIST ']' ] ':' TYPE_IDENT ;

PROPERTY_SPECIFIER = 'read' DESIGNATOR
                   | 'write' DESIGNATOR
                   | 'stored' ( BOOL_CONST | IDENT )
                   | 'default' CONST_EXPR
                   | 'nodefault'
                   | 'index' CONST_EXPR
                   | 'implements' IDENT_LIST
                   | 'dispid' CONST_EXPR ;
```

#### 8.10.1 Basic Properties

```pascal
property Name: string read FName write SetName;
```

- **`read`** specifier: a field name or getter method.
- **`write`** specifier: a field name or setter method. If omitted, the property is read-only.

Getter signature: `function GetX: T;` (no extra params) or `function GetX: T;` for a field `FX: T`.

Setter signature: `procedure SetX(const Value: T);` or `procedure SetX(Value: T);`.

#### 8.10.2 Array Properties (Indexed Properties)

```pascal
property Items[Index: Integer]: TItem read GetItem write SetItem;
```

Array properties take one or more index parameters. The getter/setter must accept the index parameters followed by (for setters) the value.

#### 8.10.3 Default Array Property

```pascal
property Items[Index: Integer]: TItem read GetItem write SetItem; default;
```

The `default` directive on an array property allows bracket access on the object: `MyList[3]` instead of `MyList.Items[3]`. Only one property per class can be the default.

#### 8.10.4 Index Specifiers

```pascal
property Red: Byte index 0 read GetColor write SetColor;
property Green: Byte index 1 read GetColor write SetColor;
property Blue: Byte index 2 read GetColor write SetColor;
```

The `index` specifier passes an integer constant to a shared getter/setter:

```pascal
function GetColor(Index: Integer): Byte;
procedure SetColor(Index: Integer; Value: Byte);
```

#### 8.10.5 The `stored` and `default` Specifiers

These control **streaming** (persistence via `TReader`/`TWriter`):

- **`stored`** — determines whether the property is saved during streaming. Can be `True`, `False`, or a Boolean field/method name.
- **`default Value`** — specifies a default value. During streaming, the property is only saved if its current value differs from the default.
- **`nodefault`** — removes an inherited default value.

#### 8.10.6 The `implements` Directive

```pascal
property Impl: IMyInterface read FImpl implements IMyInterface;
```

Delegates an interface implementation to another object. See §9.6.

#### 8.10.7 Class Properties

```pascal
class property Instance: TSingleton read FInstance;
```

Class properties are accessed through the class, not instances. Their getters/setters must be class methods or class fields.

### 8.11 Events

An **event** is a property of a procedural type (typically a method pointer):

```pascal
type
  TNotifyEvent = procedure(Sender: TObject) of object;
  TButton = class
  private
    FOnClick: TNotifyEvent;
  published
    property OnClick: TNotifyEvent read FOnClick write FOnClick;
  end;
```

Events enable the observer pattern: the object calls the assigned method (if not `nil`) when the event occurs.

### 8.12 Operators (Class Operator Overloading)

Classes can overload operators (though this is more common for records — see Chapter 10):

```pascal
class operator Implicit(const A: TMyClass): string;
class operator Explicit(const A: TMyClass): Integer;
```

See §10.4 for the full list of overloadable operators.

### 8.13 TObject — The Root Class

All classes descend from `TObject`, defined in the `System` unit. Key members:

```pascal
TObject = class
  constructor Create;
  procedure Free;
  class function InitInstance(Instance: Pointer): TObject;
  procedure CleanupInstance;
  function ClassType: TClass;
  class function ClassName: string;
  class function ClassNameIs(const Name: string): Boolean;
  class function ClassParent: TClass;
  class function ClassInfo: Pointer;
  class function InstanceSize: Integer;
  class function InheritsFrom(AClass: TClass): Boolean;
  class function MethodAddress(const Name: ShortString): Pointer;
  class function MethodName(Address: Pointer): string;
  class function QualifiedClassName: string;
  function FieldAddress(const Name: ShortString): Pointer;
  function GetInterface(const IID: TGUID; out Obj): Boolean;
  class function GetInterfaceEntry(const IID: TGUID): PInterfaceEntry;
  class function GetInterfaceTable: PInterfaceTable;
  class function UnitName: string;
  class function UnitScope: string;
  function Equals(Obj: TObject): Boolean; virtual;
  function GetHashCode: Integer; virtual;
  function ToString: string; virtual;
  procedure AfterConstruction; virtual;
  procedure BeforeDestruction; virtual;
  procedure Dispatch(var Message); virtual;
  procedure DefaultHandler(var Message); virtual;
  class function NewInstance: TObject; virtual;
  procedure FreeInstance; virtual;
  destructor Destroy; virtual;
end;
```

### 8.14 Class References (Metaclasses)

```
CLASS_REF_TYPE = 'class' 'of' CLASS_TYPE_IDENT ;
```

```pascal
type
  TClass = class of TObject;
  TAnimalClass = class of TAnimal;
```

A class-reference variable holds a class (not an instance). It can be used to:

1. Call constructors: `MyClass.Create` (virtual construction).
2. Call class methods: `MyClass.ClassName`.
3. Test with `is` and cast with `as`.
4. Compare: `if MyClass = TDog then ...`

### 8.15 Class Helpers

```
CLASS_HELPER = 'class' 'helper' [ '(' PARENT_HELPER ')' ] 'for' CLASS_TYPE
               { MEMBER_DECLARATION }
               'end' ;
```

```pascal
type
  TStringHelper = class helper for TObject
    procedure Log;
  end;
```

Rules:
1. Only one class helper per class can be active in a given scope.
2. Class helpers can add methods and properties but **not** fields.
3. `Self` in a class helper refers to the instance of the helped class.
4. Helpers can access `private` and `protected` members of the helped class (within the same unit).

### 8.16 Nested Types and Constants

Classes may contain nested type and constant declarations:

```pascal
type
  TContainer = class
  public
    type
      TItem = record
        Value: Integer;
      end;
    const
      MaxItems = 100;
  private
    FItems: array of TItem;
  end;
```

Nested types are accessed as `TContainer.TItem`.

### 8.17 Object Memory Layout

An object instance in memory is laid out as follows:

```
Offset 0: Pointer to VMT (the class pointer)
Offset 4/8: Fields from TObject
... fields from ancestor classes ...
... fields from this class (in declaration order) ...
```

The first field is always a pointer to the **Virtual Method Table**, which in turn contains:

1. Pointers to virtual and dynamic method implementations
2. RTTI pointer
3. Interface table pointer
4. Class name
5. Instance size
6. Parent class pointer
7. And other metadata

### 8.18 Alignment and Packing

Fields are aligned according to their type's natural alignment:

| Type size | Default alignment |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 byte    | 1                 |
| 2 bytes   | 2                 |
| 3 bytes   | 1                 |
| 4 bytes   | 4                 |
| 5-8 bytes | 8                 |
| >8 bytes  | 8                 |

The `packed` keyword or `{$A1}` directive removes alignment padding:

```pascal
type
  TPackedRec = packed record
    A: Byte;
    B: Integer;  // no padding before B
  end;
```

Alignment directives: `{$A1}`, `{$A2}`, `{$A4}`, `{$A8}` (default), `{$A16}`.

### 8.19 The `packed` Modifier

`packed` can be applied to arrays, records, sets, and file types. It removes alignment padding between elements/fields, producing the densest possible layout at the potential cost of slower access on some architectures.

## Chapter 9: Interfaces

### 9.1 Interface Declaration

```
INTERFACE_TYPE = 'interface' [ INTERFACE_HERITAGE ] [ '[' GUID ']' ]
                 { INTERFACE_MEMBER }
                 'end'
               | 'interface' ;   (* forward declaration *)

INTERFACE_HERITAGE = '(' INTF_TYPE_REF { ',' INTF_TYPE_REF } ')' ;
GUID = STRING_LITERAL ;  (* format: '{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}' *)

INTERFACE_MEMBER = PROCEDURE_HEADER ';' [ CALLING_CONV ';' ]
                 | FUNCTION_HEADER ';' [ CALLING_CONV ';' ]
                 | PROPERTY_DECLARATION ;
```

Example:

```pascal
type
  ILogger = interface
    ['{A1B2C3D4-E5F6-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890}']
    procedure Log(const Msg: string);
    function GetLevel: Integer;
    procedure SetLevel(Value: Integer);
    property Level: Integer read GetLevel write SetLevel;
  end;
```

### 9.2 IInterface — The Root Interface

All interfaces implicitly descend from `IInterface` (aliased as `IUnknown` for COM compatibility):

```pascal
IInterface = interface
  ['{00000000-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}']
  function QueryInterface(const IID: TGUID; out Obj): HResult; stdcall;
  function _AddRef: Integer; stdcall;
  function _Release: Integer; stdcall;
end;
```

These three methods support **reference counting** and **interface querying**.

### 9.3 Implementing Interfaces

A class implements an interface by listing it in the class heritage:

```pascal
type
  TConsoleLogger = class(TInterfacedObject, ILogger)
    procedure Log(const Msg: string);
    function GetLevel: Integer;
    procedure SetLevel(Value: Integer);
  end;
```

Rules:

1. The class must implement **all** methods declared in the interface (and all ancestor interfaces).
2. Method names and signatures must match exactly.
3. A class may implement multiple interfaces.

### 9.4 Method Resolution Clauses

When a class implements multiple interfaces with conflicting method names:

```pascal
type
  TDual = class(TInterfacedObject, IFoo, IBar)
    procedure IFoo.DoSomething = DoFoo;
    procedure IBar.DoSomething = DoBar;
    procedure DoFoo;
    procedure DoBar;
  end;
```

The method resolution clause maps interface methods to differently-named class methods.

### 9.5 Reference Counting and Lifetime

#### 9.5.1 TInterfacedObject

`TInterfacedObject` provides the standard reference-counted implementation:

```pascal
TInterfacedObject = class(TObject, IInterface)
  protected
    FRefCount: Integer;
    function QueryInterface(const IID: TGUID; out Obj): HResult; stdcall;
    function _AddRef: Integer; stdcall;
    function _Release: Integer; stdcall;
  public
    property RefCount: Integer read FRefCount;
    procedure AfterConstruction; override;
    procedure BeforeDestruction; override;
  end;
```

- `_AddRef` increments `FRefCount` (atomically).
- `_Release` decrements `FRefCount`; when it reaches 0, the object is destroyed.

#### 9.5.2 Compiler-Generated Reference Management

The compiler automatically inserts `_AddRef` and `_Release` calls for interface variables:

```pascal
var Intf: ILogger;
Intf := TConsoleLogger.Create;  // _AddRef called
// ... use Intf ...
Intf := nil;                    // _Release called → may destroy object
```

Interface variables are initialized to `nil` and finalized (released) when going out of scope.

#### 9.5.3 Non-Reference-Counted Interfaces

To disable reference counting (e.g., for an object whose lifetime is managed manually):

```pascal
function _AddRef: Integer; stdcall;
begin
  Result := -1;  // signal: not reference counted
end;
function _Release: Integer; stdcall;
begin
  Result := -1;
end;
```

Or inherit from `TSingletonImplementation` or `TAggregatedObject` which provide this behavior.

### 9.6 Interface Delegation (`implements`)

```pascal
type
  TWrapper = class(TInterfacedObject, ILogger)
  private
    FLogger: ILogger;
  public
    property Logger: ILogger read FLogger implements ILogger;
  end;
```

The `implements` directive delegates an entire interface to a field or property. The delegating object does not need to implement the interface methods itself — they are forwarded to the delegate.

Rules:
1. The property type must be the interface type or a class implementing it.
2. The property must have a `read` specifier.
3. If the delegate is a class (not an interface), `as` is used internally to obtain the interface.

### 9.7 IDispatch and Dispatch Interfaces

```pascal
type
  IMyDispatch = dispinterface
    ['{...}']
    procedure DoSomething; dispid 1;
    property Value: Integer dispid 2;
  end;
```

`dispinterface` declares a COM dispatch interface for late binding via `IDispatch.Invoke`. Methods and properties are identified by dispatch IDs (`dispid`).

### 9.8 Interface GUIDs

Interfaces may have a GUID:

```pascal
['{A1B2C3D4-E5F6-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890}']
```

A GUID is required for:
- `QueryInterface` / `Supports` / `as` to work at runtime.
- COM interoperability.

Interfaces without a GUID can still be used for compile-time polymorphism but cannot be queried at runtime.

### 9.9 The `Supports` Function

```pascal
function Supports(const Instance: TObject; const IID: TGUID; out Intf): Boolean;
function Supports(const Instance: IInterface; const IID: TGUID; out Intf): Boolean;
```

`Supports` is a safer alternative to `as` — it returns `False` instead of raising an exception.

## Chapter 10: Advanced Records

### 10.1 Overview

Records may contain methods, properties, operators, constructors, nested types, and class members. This makes records behave like lightweight classes, but they remain **value types** with no inheritance and no virtual dispatch.

```pascal
type
  TVector3 = record
  private
    FX, FY, FZ: Double;
  public
    constructor Create(AX, AY, AZ: Double);
    function Length: Double;
    function Normalized: TVector3;
    class function Zero: TVector3; static;
    class operator Add(const A, B: TVector3): TVector3;
    class operator Implicit(const A: TVector3): string;
    property X: Double read FX write FX;
    property Y: Double read FY write FY;
    property Z: Double read FZ write FZ;
  end;
```

### 10.2 Record Constructors

Records may have constructors (but not destructors):

```pascal
constructor TVector3.Create(AX, AY, AZ: Double);
begin
  FX := AX;
  FY := AY;
  FZ := AZ;
end;
```

Rules:
1. Record constructors must have at least one parameter (the parameterless "constructor" is the default zero-initialization, which cannot be overridden).
2. Record constructors do not allocate memory — they initialize `Self` in place.

### 10.3 Record Methods

Records may have instance methods and class/static methods. Instance methods receive `Self` by reference (allowing modification). In a `const` context, `Self` is read-only.

### 10.4 Operator Overloading

Records (and classes) can overload operators using the `class operator` syntax:

```pascal
class operator Add(const A, B: TMyType): TMyType;
class operator Subtract(const A, B: TMyType): TMyType;
```

Complete list of overloadable operators:

| Operator name   | Pascal symbol | Description              |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| `Implicit`      | (assignment)  | Implicit type conversion |
| `Explicit`      | `T(x)`        | Explicit type cast       |
| `Negative`      | `-`           | Unary negation           |
| `Positive`      | `+`           | Unary positive           |
| `Inc`           | `Inc(x)`      | Increment                |
| `Dec`           | `Dec(x)`      | Decrement                |
| `LogicalNot`    | `not`         | Logical NOT              |
| `Trunc`         | `Trunc(x)`    | Truncate to integer      |
| `Round`         | `Round(x)`    | Round to integer         |
| `In`            | `in`          | Set membership           |
| `Equal`         | `=`           | Equality                 |
| `NotEqual`      | `<>`          | Inequality               |
| `GreaterThan`   | `>`           | Greater than             |
| `GreaterThanOrEqual` | `>=`    | Greater or equal         |
| `LessThan`      | `<`           | Less than                |
| `LessThanOrEqual` | `<=`       | Less or equal            |
| `Add`           | `+`           | Addition                 |
| `Subtract`      | `-`           | Subtraction              |
| `Multiply`      | `*`           | Multiplication           |
| `Divide`        | `/`           | Real division            |
| `IntDivide`     | `div`         | Integer division         |
| `Modulus`       | `mod`         | Modulus                  |
| `LeftShift`     | `shl`         | Left shift               |
| `RightShift`    | `shr`         | Right shift              |
| `LogicalAnd`    | `and`         | Logical/bitwise AND      |
| `LogicalOr`     | `or`          | Logical/bitwise OR       |
| `LogicalXor`    | `xor`         | Logical/bitwise XOR      |
| `BitwiseAnd`    | `and`         | Same as LogicalAnd       |
| `BitwiseOr`     | `or`          | Same as LogicalOr        |
| `BitwiseXor`    | `xor`         | Same as LogicalXor       |

Rules:
1. At least one parameter must be of the declaring type.
2. `Implicit` and `Explicit` have exactly one parameter.
3. Binary operators have exactly two parameters; unary operators have one.
4. Overloaded operators are resolved using the same overload resolution rules as functions.

### 10.5 Record Helpers

```pascal
type
  TDateTimeHelper = record helper for TDateTime
    function ToString: string;
    function Year: Word;
  end;
```

Record helpers extend existing record types or simple types with additional methods. Same scope rules as class helpers (§8.15) and type helpers (§3.11).

### 10.6 Managed Records (Delphi 10.4+)

Records with the `class operator Initialize` and `class operator Finalize` operators are **managed records**:

```pascal
type
  TManagedRec = record
    Data: Pointer;
    class operator Initialize(out Dest: TManagedRec);
    class operator Finalize(var Dest: TManagedRec);
    class operator Assign(var Dest: TManagedRec; const [ref] Src: TManagedRec);
  end;
```

| Operator     | When called                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Initialize` | When a variable of this type comes into scope       |
| `Finalize`   | When a variable goes out of scope or is disposed    |
| `Assign`     | When one variable is assigned to another            |

Rules:
1. `Initialize` receives an `out` parameter (zero-initialized before the call).
2. `Finalize` receives a `var` parameter.
3. `Assign` receives `var Dest` and `const [ref] Src`.
4. If `Assign` is not defined, assignment copies bytes then calls `Initialize` for the destination's managed sub-fields.
5. Managed records incur overhead: the compiler inserts `Initialize`/`Finalize` calls around every scope where such a record exists.

## Chapter 11: Generics

### 11.1 Overview

Generics (parameterized types) allow types and routines to be parameterized by one or more type parameters. Delphi generics are instantiated at **compile time** (similar to C++ templates but with constraints).

### 11.2 Generic Type Declarations

```
GENERIC_TYPE_DECL = IDENT '<' TYPE_PARAM_LIST '>' '=' TYPE ;
TYPE_PARAM_LIST   = TYPE_PARAM { ',' TYPE_PARAM } ;
TYPE_PARAM        = IDENT [ ':' CONSTRAINT_LIST ] ;
CONSTRAINT_LIST   = CONSTRAINT { ',' CONSTRAINT } ;
CONSTRAINT        = 'class'
                  | 'record'
                  | 'constructor'
                  | INTERFACE_TYPE
                  | CLASS_TYPE ;
```

#### 11.2.1 Generic Classes

```pascal
type
  TStack<T> = class
  private
    FItems: TArray<T>;
    FCount: Integer;
  public
    procedure Push(const Item: T);
    function Pop: T;
    function Peek: T;
    property Count: Integer read FCount;
  end;
```

#### 11.2.2 Generic Records

```pascal
type
  TNullable<T: record> = record
  private
    FValue: T;
    FHasValue: Boolean;
  public
    constructor Create(const AValue: T);
    property HasValue: Boolean read FHasValue;
    property Value: T read FValue;
  end;
```

#### 11.2.3 Generic Interfaces

```pascal
type
  IComparer<T> = interface
    function Compare(const Left, Right: T): Integer;
  end;
```

### 11.3 Type Constraints

Constraints restrict what types may be used as type arguments:

| Constraint      | Meaning                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `class`         | T must be a class type (reference type)                 |
| `record`        | T must be a value type (record, not a class)            |
| `constructor`   | T must have a parameterless constructor                  |
| `IInterface`    | T must implement the specified interface                  |
| `TBaseClass`    | T must be the specified class or a descendant            |

Multiple constraints can be combined:

```pascal
type
  TEntity<T: class, constructor, ISerializable> = class
    // T must be a class, have a parameterless constructor,
    // and implement ISerializable
  end;
```

#### 11.3.1 Operations Permitted by Constraints

Without constraints, only these operations are permitted on a type parameter `T`:
- Assignment
- Comparison with `nil` (only if T might be a reference type — ambiguous without constraints)
- `SizeOf(T)`, `Default(T)`, `TypeInfo(T)`

With the `class` constraint:
- Comparison with `nil`
- `Free`, `is`, `as`
- Access to `TObject` members

With a specific class constraint `TFoo`:
- All members of `TFoo` are accessible

With an interface constraint `IFoo`:
- All members of `IFoo` are accessible

With the `constructor` constraint:
- `T.Create` (parameterless constructor call)

With the `record` constraint:
- The type parameter is guaranteed to be a value type
- No nil comparison allowed

### 11.4 Generic Methods

Standalone procedures/functions and methods can be generic:

```pascal
function Max<T: record>(const A, B: T): T;
// Note: requires IComparer or operator support to actually compare

procedure TMyClass.Process<T>(const Item: T);
```

#### 11.4.1 Type Inference

The compiler can infer type arguments for generic method calls in many cases:

```pascal
var X := Max<Integer>(3, 5);  // explicit
var Y := Max(3, 5);           // inferred: T = Integer
```

Type inference is not supported for generic type instantiations (only for method calls).

### 11.5 Generic Instantiation

A generic type is instantiated by providing type arguments:

```pascal
var
  IntStack: TStack<Integer>;
  StrStack: TStack<string>;
```

Each distinct instantiation produces a separate type. `TStack<Integer>` and `TStack<string>` are different types with no relationship.

### 11.6 Implementation Model

Delphi generics use a **code-specialization** model:

1. The generic type/method body is parsed and partially validated at declaration time.
2. At each instantiation point, the compiler creates a specialized copy with the type parameters replaced by actual types.
3. Full semantic analysis (including overload resolution and type checking) occurs on the specialized copy.
4. The linker may merge identical specializations to reduce code size (implementation-defined).

This means:
- Errors in the generic body that depend on the type argument are detected at **instantiation time**, not declaration time.
- The generic body can use operations not visible from constraints if the actual type supports them (but this is unreliable and not recommended).

### 11.7 Generic Constraints vs. Duck Typing

Unlike C++ templates, Delphi generics are **constrained**: you can only use operations on `T` that are guaranteed by the constraints. Code that relies on unconstrained operations may compile for some type arguments but fail for others. Best practice is to always specify appropriate constraints.

### 11.8 Predefined Generic Types

The `System` and `System.Generics.Collections` units provide:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TArray<T>` | Alias for `array of T` |
| `TList<T>` | Generic dynamic list |
| `TDictionary<TKey, TValue>` | Hash map |
| `TQueue<T>` | FIFO queue |
| `TStack<T>` | LIFO stack |
| `TObjectList<T: class>` | List that owns its objects |
| `TObjectDictionary<TKey, TValue>` | Dictionary with ownership options |
| `TComparer<T>` | Default comparer factory |
| `TEqualityComparer<T>` | Default equality comparer |
| `TPair<TKey, TValue>` | Key-value pair record |

### 11.9 Covariance and Contravariance

Object Pascal generics do **not** support variance annotations. `TList<TDog>` is not assignable to `TList<TAnimal>` even though `TDog` inherits from `TAnimal`. This is a deliberate design decision to preserve type safety.

### 11.10 Nested Generics and Complex Instantiation

Generic types may be nested inside other generic types:

```pascal
type
  TOuter<T> = class
    type
      TInner = class
        Value: T;
      end;
  end;
```

Instantiation: `TOuter<Integer>.TInner`.

Generic types can also be used as type arguments:

```pascal
var Dict: TDictionary<string, TList<Integer>>;
```

The `>>` at the end is correctly parsed as two closing angle brackets (not a shift operator) in a generic context.

---

## Chapter 12: Anonymous Methods and Method References

### 12.1 Method Reference Types

```
METHOD_REFERENCE = 'reference' 'to' ( PROCEDURE_TYPE | FUNCTION_TYPE ) ;
```

```pascal
type
  TProc = reference to procedure;
  TFunc<T, TResult> = reference to function(const Arg: T): TResult;
  TPredicate<T> = reference to function(const Value: T): Boolean;
```

Method reference types can hold:
1. An **anonymous method** (closure)
2. A **regular procedure/function** (standalone)
3. A **method of object** (bound method)

This makes them the most flexible procedural type.

### 12.2 Anonymous Method Syntax

```pascal
var
  Greet: TProc;
begin
  Greet := procedure
    begin
      WriteLn('Hello');
    end;
  Greet();
end;
```

```pascal
var
  Add: TFunc<Integer, Integer, Integer>;
begin
  Add := function(const A, B: Integer): Integer
    begin
      Result := A + B;
    end;
end;
```

### 12.3 Variable Capture (Closures)

Anonymous methods can capture variables from the enclosing scope:

```pascal
function CreateCounter: TFunc<Integer>;
var
  Count: Integer;
begin
  Count := 0;
  Result := function: Integer
    begin
      Inc(Count);
      Result := Count;
    end;
end;
```

Rules:

1. Captured variables are captured **by reference**, not by value. Changes to the variable inside the anonymous method affect the original, and vice versa.
2. Captured variables are **lifetime-extended**: they are moved from the stack to a hidden reference-counted **capture object** (implemented as a compiler-generated interface). They survive as long as any anonymous method referencing them exists.
3. Multiple anonymous methods in the same scope share the same capture object (and thus the same captured variables).
4. Loop variables captured by reference share a single storage location, which may lead to unexpected behavior (all closures see the final value). This is a well-known gotcha.

### 12.4 Implementation Details

The compiler implements anonymous methods as:

1. A hidden class implementing an anonymous interface.
2. The captured variables become fields of this hidden class.
3. The anonymous method body becomes a method of the hidden class.
4. The method reference variable holds an interface reference to this hidden object.
5. Reference counting on the interface manages the lifetime of the capture object.

### 12.5 Compatibility

Method references are **not** type-compatible with `procedure of object` or plain `procedure` pointer types. They are a distinct category:

```pascal
type
  TPlainProc = procedure;
  TMethodProc = procedure of object;
  TRefProc = reference to procedure;
```

A `reference to` variable can hold all three kinds, but the reverse is not true. A `procedure of object` variable cannot hold an anonymous method.

---

## Chapter 13: Exception Handling

### 13.1 Exception Types

Exceptions in Object Pascal are objects — instances of classes that descend from `Exception` (defined in `System.SysUtils`):

```pascal
Exception = class(TObject)
  constructor Create(const Msg: string);
  constructor CreateFmt(const Msg: string; const Args: array of const);
  property Message: string;
  property HelpContext: Integer;
  property StackTrace: string;  // Delphi 12+
end;
```

Standard exception classes include:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `EAbort` | Silent exception (does not display error) |
| `EAbstractError` | Call to abstract method |
| `EAccessViolation` | Invalid memory access |
| `EArgumentException` | Invalid argument |
| `EArgumentNilException` | Nil argument |
| `EArgumentOutOfRangeException` | Argument out of range |
| `EConvertError` | Type conversion error |
| `EDivByZero` | Integer division by zero |
| `EInOutError` | File I/O error |
| `EIntOverflow` | Integer overflow |
| `EInvalidCast` | Invalid typecast |
| `EInvalidOp` | Invalid floating-point operation |
| `ENotImplemented` | Feature not implemented |
| `EOutOfMemory` | Memory allocation failure |
| `ERangeError` | Range check error |
| `EStackOverflow` | Stack overflow |
| `EOverflow` | Floating-point overflow |
| `EUnderflow` | Floating-point underflow |
| `EZeroDivide` | Floating-point division by zero |

### 13.2 The `raise` Statement

```
RAISE_STMT = 'raise' [ EXPRESSION ] [ 'at' EXPRESSION ] ;
```

```pascal
raise Exception.Create('Something went wrong');
raise EArgumentException.CreateFmt('Invalid value: %d', [Value]);
raise;  // re-raise current exception (in except block only)
raise E at ReturnAddr;  // raise with custom return address
```

Rules:
1. The expression must evaluate to an object (class instance). By convention, a new exception object is created at the `raise` site.
2. After `raise`, control transfers to the nearest enclosing exception handler.
3. A bare `raise` (no expression) in an `except` block re-raises the current exception without destroying it.
4. The `at` clause specifies a code address for the exception's origin (for debugging).

### 13.3 The `try..except` Statement

```
TRY_EXCEPT = 'try'
               STMT_LIST
             'except'
               EXCEPTION_HANDLER_LIST
             'end' ;

EXCEPTION_HANDLER_LIST = EXCEPTION_HANDLER { ';' EXCEPTION_HANDLER }
                       | STMT_LIST ;

EXCEPTION_HANDLER = 'on' [ IDENT ':' ] TYPE_IDENT 'do' STATEMENT ;
```

Example:

```pascal
try
  DoSomething;
except
  on E: EConvertError do
    WriteLn('Conversion error: ', E.Message);
  on E: Exception do
    WriteLn('Error: ', E.Message);
  // no 'else' needed — unhandled exceptions propagate
end;
```

Rules:

1. Exception handlers are checked **top to bottom**; the first matching handler executes.
2. A handler `on E: TFoo do ...` matches if the exception object is an instance of `TFoo` or a descendant.
3. `E` is a local variable bound to the exception object within the handler.
4. If the handler does not re-raise the exception, the exception object is **destroyed** (freed) after the handler completes.
5. An `else` clause (or bare statement list without `on` handlers) catches all exceptions.
6. After the handler executes, control continues after the `end` of the `try..except`.

### 13.4 The `try..finally` Statement

```
TRY_FINALLY = 'try'
                STMT_LIST
              'finally'
                STMT_LIST
              'end' ;
```

```pascal
Stream := TFileStream.Create('data.bin', fmOpenRead);
try
  // use Stream
finally
  Stream.Free;  // always executed
end;
```

Rules:

1. The `finally` block **always** executes, whether the `try` block completes normally, raises an exception, or calls `Exit`/`Break`/`Continue`.
2. If an exception is pending, it is held during the `finally` block. After `finally` completes:
   - If `finally` raises a new exception, the original exception is destroyed and the new one propagates.
   - If `finally` completes normally, the original exception continues to propagate.
3. `try..finally` does not handle exceptions — it only ensures cleanup. For handling, use `try..except`.

### 13.5 Nested Exception Handling

`try..except` and `try..finally` can be nested:

```pascal
try
  try
    DoSomething;
  except
    on E: Exception do
      LogError(E.Message);  // handle
  end;
finally
  Cleanup;  // always runs
end;
```

### 13.6 Exception Chaining (Nested Exceptions)

Delphi supports exception chaining via `Exception.RaiseOuterException` and `Exception.InnerException`:

```pascal
try
  DoSomething;
except
  on E: Exception do
    Exception.RaiseOuterException(
      EMyException.Create('Wrapper: ' + E.Message));
end;
```

The original exception is preserved in the `InnerException` property.

### 13.7 Abort

`Abort` raises `EAbort`, a "silent" exception that is caught by the application's default handler without displaying an error message. It is used to cancel an operation without alarming the user.

## Chapter 14: Memory Management and Object Lifecycle

### 14.1 Memory Model Overview

Object Pascal uses **manual memory management** for class instances on the desktop/server compilers (Win32, Win64, Linux, macOS). Developers are responsible for creating and destroying objects.

#### 14.1.1 Stack Allocation
- Value types (integers, floats, records, static arrays, sets) are allocated on the stack for local variables.
- Passed by value to functions, copied on assignment.

#### 14.1.2 Heap Allocation
- Class instances are always heap-allocated (via `TObject.NewInstance` → `GetMem`).
- Dynamic arrays and long strings are heap-allocated and reference-counted.
- Pointers obtained via `New`, `GetMem`, `AllocMem`, or `ReallocMem` are heap-allocated.

### 14.2 Object Creation and Destruction

```pascal
var Obj: TMyClass;
Obj := TMyClass.Create;   // allocate + initialize
try
  // use Obj
finally
  Obj.Free;               // destroy + deallocate
end;
```

The `try..finally` pattern is the standard idiom for object lifetime management.

#### 14.2.1 FreeAndNil

```pascal
procedure FreeAndNil(var Obj);
```

`FreeAndNil` frees the object and sets the variable to `nil`. This prevents dangling pointer access.

### 14.3 Reference Counting

The following types are **reference-counted** with **copy-on-write** (COW):

| Type | Ref-counted | COW |
|------|-------------|-----|
| `string` (UnicodeString) | Yes | Yes |
| `AnsiString` | Yes | Yes |
| Dynamic arrays | Yes | No (shared reference on assign) |
| Interfaces | Yes | No (shared, not COW) |
| `Variant` | By value (deep copy on assign) | N/A |

Reference counts are managed atomically (thread-safe increment/decrement).

### 14.4 Low-Level Memory Routines

| Routine | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `GetMem(P, Size)` | Allocate Size bytes, store pointer in P |
| `FreeMem(P)` | Free memory at P |
| `ReallocMem(P, Size)` | Resize allocation |
| `AllocMem(Size)` | Allocate and zero-fill |
| `New(P)` | Allocate a typed pointer (`P: ^T`) |
| `Dispose(P)` | Free a typed pointer, finalize managed fields |
| `Initialize(V)` | Initialize managed fields of a variable |
| `Finalize(V)` | Finalize managed fields (release refs) |
| `Move(Src, Dst, Count)` | Copy bytes (no overlap check) |
| `FillChar(V, Count, Value)` | Fill memory with a byte value |

### 14.5 Weak References

Delphi supports the `[weak]` attribute for interface references to break reference cycles:

```pascal
type
  TChild = class
  private
    [weak] FParent: IParent;  // weak reference — does not prevent destruction
  end;
```

When the referenced object is destroyed, weak references are automatically set to `nil`.

`[unsafe]` is a variant that does not participate in reference counting at all (no `_AddRef`/`_Release`) and is **not** automatically zeroed.

### 14.6 Managed Types Summary

A type is "managed" if it requires compiler-generated initialization, finalization, or reference-count management:

| Managed type | Requires |
|-------------|----------|
| `string` (any) | Ref-count, finalize |
| Dynamic array | Ref-count, finalize |
| Interface | Ref-count, finalize |
| Variant | Deep copy, finalize |
| Record with managed fields | Recursive init/finalize |
| Managed record (Initialize/Finalize operators) | Custom init/finalize |

When a managed type goes out of scope, the compiler inserts finalization code.

## Chapter 15: Runtime Type Information (RTTI) and Attributes

### 15.1 RTTI Overview

Object Pascal generates **Runtime Type Information** (RTTI) for types, enabling reflection, serialization, and the streaming system. The amount of RTTI generated is controlled by compiler directives and visibility.

### 15.2 Classic RTTI (`TypInfo` Unit)

The classic RTTI system provides information about `published` properties and methods. Key types:

```pascal
type
  TTypeKind = (
    tkUnknown, tkInteger, tkChar, tkEnumeration, tkFloat,
    tkString, tkSet, tkClass, tkMethod, tkWChar, tkLString,
    tkWString, tkVariant, tkArray, tkRecord, tkInterface,
    tkInt64, tkDynArray, tkUString, tkClassRef, tkPointer,
    tkProcedure, tkMRecord
  );
```

Key functions:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GetPropInfo(TypeInfo, PropName)` | Get property info by name |
| `GetPropValue(Instance, PropName)` | Get property value as Variant |
| `SetPropValue(Instance, PropName, Value)` | Set property value |
| `GetPropList(TypeInfo, ...)` | Get list of published properties |
| `IsPublishedProp(Instance, PropName)` | Check if property exists |

### 15.3 Extended RTTI (`System.Rtti` Unit, Delphi 2010+)

Extended RTTI provides comprehensive reflection for all types and members at all visibility levels (controlled by `{$RTTI}` directive).

#### 15.3.1 Core Types

```pascal
type
  TRttiContext = record
    function GetType(ATypeInfo: Pointer): TRttiType;
    function GetType(AClass: TClass): TRttiType;
    function FindType(const QualifiedName: string): TRttiType;
    function GetTypes: TArray<TRttiType>;
  end;

  TRttiType = class
    property Name: string;
    property QualifiedName: string;
    property TypeKind: TTypeKind;
    property TypeSize: Integer;
    property Handle: PTypeInfo;
    function GetMethods: TArray<TRttiMethod>;
    function GetMethod(const AName: string): TRttiMethod;
    function GetProperties: TArray<TRttiProperty>;
    function GetProperty(const AName: string): TRttiProperty;
    function GetFields: TArray<TRttiField>;
    function GetField(const AName: string): TRttiField;
    function GetAttributes: TArray<TCustomAttribute>;
  end;

  TRttiMethod = class(TRttiMember)
    property ReturnType: TRttiType;
    function GetParameters: TArray<TRttiParameter>;
    function Invoke(Instance: TObject; const Args: array of TValue): TValue;
    function Invoke(Instance: TClass; const Args: array of TValue): TValue;
  end;

  TRttiProperty = class(TRttiMember)
    property PropertyType: TRttiType;
    function GetValue(Instance: Pointer): TValue;
    procedure SetValue(Instance: Pointer; const AValue: TValue);
    property IsReadable: Boolean;
    property IsWritable: Boolean;
  end;

  TRttiField = class(TRttiMember)
    property FieldType: TRttiType;
    property Offset: Integer;
    function GetValue(Instance: Pointer): TValue;
    procedure SetValue(Instance: Pointer; const AValue: TValue);
  end;
```

#### 15.3.2 TValue

`TValue` is a universal value container (like a typed Variant) that can hold any Delphi value:

```pascal
var V: TValue;
V := TValue.From<Integer>(42);
V := TValue.From<string>('Hello');
var I := V.AsInteger;
var S := V.AsString;
```

### 15.4 Attributes

Attributes are custom metadata annotations attached to types, fields, methods, properties, and parameters.

#### 15.4.1 Declaring Custom Attributes

```pascal
type
  TableAttribute = class(TCustomAttribute)
  private
    FName: string;
  public
    constructor Create(const AName: string);
    property Name: string read FName;
  end;

  RequiredAttribute = class(TCustomAttribute)
  end;
```

All attributes must descend from `TCustomAttribute`.

#### 15.4.2 Applying Attributes

```pascal
type
  [Table('Users')]
  TUser = class
  private
    [Required]
    FName: string;
    [Column('email_address')]
    FEmail: string;
  public
    property Name: string read FName write FName;
    property Email: string read FEmail write FEmail;
  end;
```

Syntax:

```
ATTRIBUTE_LIST = '[' ATTRIBUTE { ',' ATTRIBUTE } ']' ;
ATTRIBUTE = TYPE_IDENT [ '(' EXPR_LIST ')' ] ;
```

Rules:
1. The attribute class name can omit the `Attribute` suffix: `[Table('X')]` resolves to `TableAttribute`.
2. Constructor arguments must be constant expressions.
3. Attributes can be applied to: types, fields, methods, properties, method parameters, and return types (`[Result: MyAttr]`).
4. Multiple attributes can be in one bracket or separate brackets.
5. The same attribute class can be applied multiple times (unless the attribute is designed to prevent this).

#### 15.4.3 Querying Attributes at Runtime

```pascal
var
  Ctx: TRttiContext;
  RttiType: TRttiType;
  Attr: TCustomAttribute;
begin
  RttiType := Ctx.GetType(TUser);
  for Attr in RttiType.GetAttributes do
    if Attr is TableAttribute then
      WriteLn('Table: ', TableAttribute(Attr).Name);
end;
```

### 15.5 The `{$RTTI}` Directive

Controls the amount of extended RTTI generated:

```pascal
{$RTTI EXPLICIT METHODS([vcPublic, vcPublished]) PROPERTIES([vcPublic, vcPublished]) FIELDS([vcPrivate..vcPublished])}
```

Options:
- `INHERIT` — use the parent type's RTTI settings
- `EXPLICIT` — specify exactly which visibility levels generate RTTI
- Visibility sets: `vcPrivate`, `vcProtected`, `vcPublic`, `vcPublished`

By default, full RTTI is generated for `published` members and limited RTTI for other visibility levels.

### 15.6 The `{$M}` Directive

`{$M+}` enables generation of `published` RTTI for a class and all its descendants. `TPersistent` has `{$M+}`, so all `TPersistent` descendants support published property streaming.

---

## Chapter 16: Inline Assembly

### 16.1 The `asm` Block

```
ASM_STMT = 'asm'
             { ASM_INSTRUCTION }
           'end' ;
```

```pascal
function SwapBytes(Value: Cardinal): Cardinal;
asm
  BSWAP EAX  // Win32: Value is in EAX, result in EAX
end;
```

### 16.2 Supported Architectures

| Platform | Instruction Set |
|----------|-----------------|
| Win32    | x86 (IA-32) with SSE/SSE2/AVX extensions |
| Win64    | x86-64 (AMD64) |
| Linux64  | x86-64 |
| macOS64  | x86-64 or ARM64 (Apple Silicon) |
| Android  | ARM32 (ARMV7) or ARM64 (AArch64) |
| iOS      | ARM64 |

Inline assembly syntax varies by target platform. Win32 uses Intel syntax (register-based calling convention by default). Win64 uses Microsoft x64 calling convention.

### 16.3 Accessing Pascal Symbols

Inside `asm` blocks, you can reference:
- Local variables by name (compiler resolves to `[EBP+offset]` or `[RBP+offset]`)
- Parameters by name
- Global variables by name
- Type sizes via `TYPE` operator
- Record fields via dot notation: `[EAX].TPoint.X`
- `Self` in methods

### 16.4 Register Conventions

#### Win32 (register calling convention):
- First three parameters in `EAX`, `EDX`, `ECX`
- Result in `EAX` (ordinal/pointer), `EAX:EDX` (64-bit), or `ST(0)` (float)
- `EBX`, `ESI`, `EDI`, `EBP` must be preserved

#### Win64 (Microsoft x64 ABI):
- First four params in `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8`, `R9` (integer/pointer) or `XMM0`-`XMM3` (float)
- Result in `RAX` or `XMM0`
- `RBX`, `RBP`, `RDI`, `RSI`, `RSP`, `R12`-`R15` must be preserved

### 16.5 Pure Assembler Routines

An entire routine can be written in assembly:

```pascal
function FastAdd(A, B: Integer): Integer;
asm
  // Win32: A in EAX, B in EDX
  ADD EAX, EDX
end;
```

The `assembler` directive is optional (the presence of `asm..end` is sufficient).

### 16.6 Restrictions

1. `asm` blocks cannot be used in `inline` routines.
2. `asm` blocks in generic types/methods are not portable.
3. Platform-specific assembly makes code non-portable.
4. The compiler does not optimize across `asm` boundaries.

---

## Chapter 17: Compiler Directives

### 17.1 Overview

Compiler directives control compilation behavior. They appear in the source as special comments:

```
DIRECTIVE = '{$' DIRECTIVE_NAME [ DIRECTIVE_ARGS ] '}'
          | '(*$' DIRECTIVE_NAME [ DIRECTIVE_ARGS ] '*)' ;
```

Directives fall into three categories:
1. **Switch directives** — toggle a boolean setting (e.g., `{$R+}`, `{$R-}`)
2. **Parameter directives** — accept a value (e.g., `{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}`)
3. **Conditional compilation directives** — control which code is compiled

### 17.2 Switch Directives

#### 17.4.2 Conditional Expressions (`{$IF}`)

`{$IF}` supports full constant expressions:

```pascal
{$IF CompilerVersion >= 36.0}
  // Delphi 12+ code
{$ENDIF}

{$IF Defined(MSWINDOWS) and not Defined(WIN64)}
  // 32-bit Windows only
{$ENDIF}

{$IF SizeOf(Pointer) = 8}
  // 64-bit platform
{$ENDIF}
```

Available functions in `{$IF}` expressions:
- `Defined(SYMBOL)` — true if symbol is defined

## Chapter 18: Calling Conventions and Interoperability

### 18.1 Calling Conventions

A **calling convention** determines how parameters are passed, how the stack is cleaned up, and which registers are preserved.

| Convention  | Keyword    | Parameter passing                        | Stack cleanup | Usage                        |
|------------|------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| Register   | `register` | First 3 in EAX/EDX/ECX (Win32); standard ABI (Win64) | Callee | Default for Object Pascal    |
| Cdecl      | `cdecl`    | Right-to-left on stack                   | Caller        | C library functions          |
| StdCall    | `stdcall`  | Right-to-left on stack                   | Callee        | Win32 API                    |
| SafeCall   | `safecall` | Like stdcall, wraps in HRESULT           | Callee        | COM methods                  |
| Pascal     | `pascal`   | Left-to-right on stack                   | Callee        | Legacy (Turbo Pascal)        |
| WinAPI     | `winapi`   | `stdcall` on Win32, `cdecl` on Win64     | Platform      | Cross-platform API calls     |

#### 18.1.1 Register Convention (Default)

On **Win32**:
- First parameter in `EAX`
- Second in `EDX`
- Third in `ECX`
- Remaining on the stack, left to right
- Result in `EAX` (ordinal/pointer up to 32 bits), `EAX:EDX` (64-bit), `ST(0)` (float)
- `Self` counts as the first parameter for methods

On **Win64** (Microsoft x64 ABI — used regardless of calling convention keyword):
- All calling conventions effectively use the Microsoft x64 ABI
- First four integer/pointer params: `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8`, `R9`
- First four float params: `XMM0`, `XMM1`, `XMM2`, `XMM3`
- Remaining on the stack
- 32-byte "shadow space" reserved by caller
- Result in `RAX` or `XMM0`

#### 18.1.2 SafeCall Convention

`safecall` is used for COM interface methods. The compiler:
1. Wraps the function body in a `try..except` that converts exceptions to `HRESULT` values.
2. Moves the declared return value to an `out` parameter.
3. The actual function returns `HRESULT`.

```pascal
// Declared as:
function GetName: string; safecall;

// Compiled as equivalent to:
function GetName(out Result: string): HRESULT; stdcall;
```

When calling a `safecall` method, the compiler:
1. Checks the returned `HRESULT`.
2. If it indicates failure, calls `SafeCallException` which raises `EOleSysError`.

### 18.2 Interoperability with C/C++

#### 18.2.1 Calling C Functions

```pascal
function strlen(s: PAnsiChar): NativeUInt; cdecl; external 'msvcrt.dll';
```

#### 18.2.2 C-to-Pascal Type Mapping

| C type | Pascal type |
|--------|-------------|
| `char` | `AnsiChar` |
| `wchar_t` | `WideChar` (Win), platform-specific |
| `short` | `SmallInt` |
| `int` | `Integer` |
| `long` | `LongInt` (Win32: 4 bytes) |
| `long long` | `Int64` |
| `unsigned char` | `Byte` |
| `unsigned short` | `Word` |
| `unsigned int` | `Cardinal` |
| `unsigned long long` | `UInt64` |
| `float` | `Single` |
| `double` | `Double` |
| `void*` | `Pointer` |
| `char*` | `PAnsiChar` |
| `wchar_t*` | `PWideChar` |
| `T*` | `^T` |
| `T[]` | `array of T` or `^T` |
| `struct` | `record` (with matching alignment) |
| `enum` | Enumerated type (check size with `{$Z}`) |
| `bool` | `LongBool` (C) or `Boolean` (C++ `bool`) |
| `BOOL` (Win32) | `LongBool` |
| `HRESULT` | `HResult` |
| `BSTR` | `WideString` |
| `VARIANT` | `OleVariant` |

#### 18.2.3 Varargs

```pascal
function printf(format: PAnsiChar): Integer; cdecl; varargs;
  external 'msvcrt.dll';
```

The `varargs` directive (used with `cdecl`) allows passing additional untyped arguments like C variadic functions.

#### 18.2.4 Callback Functions

C libraries that accept function pointers can use Pascal procedural types with matching calling conventions:

```pascal
type
  TCompareFunc = function(const A, B: Pointer): Integer; cdecl;

procedure qsort(base: Pointer; num, size: NativeUInt; compare: TCompareFunc); cdecl;
  external 'msvcrt.dll';
```

### 18.3 COM Interoperability

#### 18.3.1 COM Interfaces

COM interfaces in Delphi use `interface` with a GUID and `stdcall` or `safecall` calling convention:

```pascal
type
  IMyComObject = interface(IUnknown)
    ['{...}']
    function QueryInterface(const IID: TGUID; out Obj): HResult; stdcall;
    function _AddRef: Integer; stdcall;
    function _Release: Integer; stdcall;
    procedure DoSomething; safecall;
  end;
```

#### 18.3.2 COM Classes and Factories

```pascal
type
  TMyComObject = class(TComObject, IMyComObject)
    procedure DoSomething; safecall;
  end;

  TMyComFactory = class(TComObjectFactory)
    // ...
  end;

initialization
  TMyComFactory.Create(ComServer, TMyComObject, CLASS_MyComObject,
    'MyComObject', '', ciMultiInstance, tmApartment);
```

#### 18.3.3 Type Libraries

Delphi can import COM type libraries to generate Pascal interface declarations. The `tlibimp` tool or IDE integration handles this.

### 18.4 Dynamic Loading

```pascal
var
  LibHandle: THandle;
  MyFunc: function(X: Integer): Integer; cdecl;
begin
  LibHandle := LoadLibrary('mylib.dll');
  if LibHandle <> 0 then
  try
    @MyFunc := GetProcAddress(LibHandle, 'MyFunc');
    if Assigned(MyFunc) then
      WriteLn(MyFunc(42));
  finally
    FreeLibrary(LibHandle);
  end;
end;
```

The `delayed` directive provides a simpler alternative:

```pascal
function MyFunc(X: Integer): Integer; cdecl;
  external 'mylib.dll' delayed;
```

---

## Chapter 19: Predefined Identifiers and Intrinsic Routines

### 19.1 Predefined Type Identifiers

The following type identifiers are predefined in the `System` unit (always in scope):

**Ordinal types:** `Boolean`, `ByteBool`, `WordBool`, `LongBool`, `Byte`, `ShortInt`, `Word`, `SmallInt`, `Cardinal`, `Integer`, `LongInt`, `LongWord`, `UInt64`, `Int64`, `NativeInt`, `NativeUInt`, `Char`, `WideChar`, `AnsiChar`

**Real types:** `Single`, `Double`, `Extended`, `Real`, `Real48`, `Comp`, `Currency`

**String types:** `string`, `UnicodeString`, `AnsiString`, `WideString`, `ShortString`, `RawByteString`, `UTF8String`

**Other:** `Pointer`, `Variant`, `OleVariant`, `TObject`, `TClass`, `IInterface`, `IUnknown`, `TGUID`, `TArray<T>`, `PChar`, `PWideChar`, `PAnsiChar`, `PByte`, `PInteger`, `PWord`

### 19.2 Predefined Constants

| Constant | Type | Value |
|----------|------|-------|
| `True` | `Boolean` | 1 |
| `False` | `Boolean` | 0 |
| `nil` | (special) | Null pointer/reference |
| `MaxInt` | `Integer` | 2147483647 |
| `MaxLongInt` | `LongInt` | 2147483647 |

### 19.3 Intrinsic Functions (Compiler Magic)

These are built into the compiler and cannot be reassigned or referenced as procedural values:

#### 19.3.1 Ordinal Functions

| Function | Signature | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `Ord(X)` | `Ord(X: ordinal): Integer` | Ordinal value |
| `Chr(X)` | `Chr(X: Byte): AnsiChar` | Character from ordinal |
| `Pred(X)` | `Pred(X: ordinal): ordinal` | Predecessor |
| `Succ(X)` | `Succ(X: ordinal): ordinal` | Successor |
| `High(X)` | `High(X): ordinal` | Highest value |
| `Low(X)` | `Low(X): ordinal` | Lowest value |
| `Odd(X)` | `Odd(X: Integer): Boolean` | True if X is odd |

### 19.4 The `System` Unit

The `System` unit is implicitly used by every unit and program. It is always in scope and is searched last (after all explicit `uses`). It declares:

- All predefined types, constants, and intrinsic routines
- `TObject`, `IInterface`, `TGUID`
- Memory manager hooks (`GetMemoryManager`, `SetMemoryManager`)
- Exception support (`ExceptObject`, `ExceptAddr`, `RaiseList`)
- Thread support (`BeginThread`, `EndThread`, `IsMultiThread`)
- Module initialization (`_InitExe`, `_InitLib`, `_Halt0`)
- Variant support types and operations

### 19.5 The `SysInit` Unit

`SysInit` is implicitly linked before `System`. It handles the earliest stages of program initialization (setting up the memory manager, exception handling, etc.).

## Appendix D: Type Compatibility and Assignment Compatibility Rules

### D.1 Type Identity

Two types `T1` and `T2` are **identical** if and only if one of:

1. `T1` and `T2` are the same type declaration.
2. `T1` is declared as `T1 = T2` (alias, without the `type` keyword).
3. Both are the same predefined type (e.g., `Integer`).

### D.2 Type Compatibility

Types `T1` and `T2` are **compatible** if:

1. `T1` and `T2` are identical.
2. Both are ordinal types and at least one is a subrange of the other (or both are subranges of the same type).
3. Both are real types.
4. Both are string types.
5. Both are set types with compatible base types.
6. Both are `packed` set types with identical base types, OR both are non-packed sets with compatible base types.
7. Both are class types and one is an ancestor of the other.
8. Both are class-reference types and one's class is an ancestor of the other's.
9. Both are procedure types with matching signatures and calling conventions.
10. Both are pointer types (`Pointer` is compatible with all pointer types).

### D.3 Assignment Compatibility

A value of type `Source` can be assigned to a variable of type `Dest` if:

1. `Source` and `Dest` are identical.
2. `Source` and `Dest` are compatible ordinal types and the source value is in the range of `Dest`.
3. `Source` and `Dest` are both real types (implicit promotion is performed).
4. `Source` is an integer type and `Dest` is a real type.
5. `Source` and `Dest` are both string types (automatic conversion occurs).
6. `Source` is a `Char` and `Dest` is a `string` type.
7. `Source` and `Dest` are compatible set types.
8. `Source` is a descendant class type of `Dest` (widening reference conversion).
9. `Source` is a class type that implements `Dest` (where `Dest` is an interface type).
10. `Source` is `nil` and `Dest` is a pointer, class, class-reference, interface, procedural, or dynamic array type.
11. `Source` is a `Variant` and `Dest` is a type for which automatic variant conversion is defined (ordinal, real, string, Boolean).
12. `Source` is a procedural type compatible with `Dest` (matching params and calling convention), or `Source` is an anonymous method compatible with `Dest`.
13. `Source` is a dynamic array type and `Dest` is the same dynamic array type (reference assignment) or `Dest` is `Pointer` or an open array parameter.

## Appendix E: Name Resolution and Overload Resolution Rules

### E.1 Name Lookup Order

When resolving an unqualified identifier, the compiler searches in this order:

1. Local scope (current block — innermost to outermost nested scope).
2. Enclosing routine scopes (for nested routines).
3. Class/record scope (if in a method body — including inherited members).
4. `with` scopes (if active, innermost first).
5. Unit implementation scope (private declarations).
6. Unit interface scope (public declarations).
7. Implementation `uses` clause (right to left — last unit wins).
8. Interface `uses` clause (right to left — last unit wins).
9. `System` unit.

The first match found is used. A qualified identifier (`UnitName.Ident`) bypasses this search and goes directly to the specified unit.

### E.2 Overload Resolution

When calling an overloaded routine:

1. **Candidate gathering**: Find all visible routines with the matching name and `overload` directive (or in the same scope).

2. **Argument matching**: For each candidate, check if the arguments can match the parameters:
   - Exact match: argument type is identical to parameter type.
   - Implicit conversion: argument type is assignment-compatible with parameter type (requires conversion).
   - Incompatible: no conversion exists → candidate eliminated.

3. **Ranking** (best to worst):
   a. Exact match (no conversion needed).
   b. Signed/unsigned promotion (e.g., `Byte` to `Integer`).
   c. Numeric widening (e.g., `Integer` to `Int64`, `Single` to `Double`).
   d. String conversion (e.g., `AnsiString` to `UnicodeString`).
   e. Variant conversion.

4. **Best candidate selection**: The candidate with the most "exact match" parameters wins. If tied, the candidate with the fewest and least-costly conversions wins.

5. **Ambiguity**: If no single best candidate can be determined, a compile-time error is issued.

### E.3 Default Parameters in Overload Resolution

Default parameters participate in overload resolution. A call `Foo(1)` can match `Foo(X: Integer)` and `Foo(X: Integer; Y: Integer = 0)`. The candidate with fewer parameters (exact arity match) is preferred.

### E.4 Generic Overload Resolution

For generic methods with type inference:
1. Type inference is attempted for each generic candidate.
2. If inference succeeds, the inferred specialization participates in overload resolution.
3. Non-generic candidates are preferred over generic candidates when both match equally well.

## Appendix F: Runtime Memory Layout

### F.1 Object Instance Layout

```
Offset 0:         Pointer to VMT (TClass)
Offset SizeOf(Pointer): Fields from TObject
...               Fields from ancestor classes (in inheritance order)
...               Fields from declaring class (in declaration order)
                  (with alignment padding as needed)
```

Total size: `TObject.InstanceSize` (includes the VMT pointer but not the heap block header).

### F.2 VMT (Virtual Method Table) Layout

The VMT pointer points to the first virtual method entry. Negative offsets contain metadata:

| Offset | Field | Type |
|--------|-------|------|
| -76 (varies) | `vmtSelfPtr` | Pointer to VMT itself |
| -72 | `vmtIntfTable` | Pointer to interface table |
| -68 | `vmtAutoTable` | Automation info |
| -64 | `vmtInitTable` | Field initialization table |
| -60 | `vmtTypeInfo` | RTTI pointer |
| -56 | `vmtFieldTable` | Published field table |
| -52 | `vmtMethodTable` | Published method table |
| -48 | `vmtDynamicTable` | Dynamic method table |
| -44 | `vmtClassName` | Pointer to class name (ShortString) |
| -40 | `vmtInstanceSize` | Instance size |
| -36 | `vmtParent` | Pointer to parent VMT |
| 0+ | Virtual method pointers | Code pointers |

(Exact offsets are platform-dependent; shown for Win32. On Win64, all offsets are doubled.)

### F.3 Dynamic Array Memory Layout

```
Header (before the pointer):
  [RefCount: Integer (4 bytes)]
  [Length: NativeInt (4 or 8 bytes)]
Data (the pointer points here):
  [Element 0][Element 1]...[Element Length-1]
```

### F.4 String Memory Layout (UnicodeString)

```
Header (before the pointer):
  [CodePage: Word (2 bytes)]
  [ElemSize: Word (2 bytes)]
  [RefCount: Integer (4 bytes)]
  [Length: Integer (4 bytes)]
Data (the pointer points here):
  [Char 0][Char 1]...[Char Length-1][#0#0]
```

The null terminator is not included in `Length`. The pointer stored in the string variable points to the first character (Char 0). A `nil` pointer represents an empty string.

## Appendix G: Program Startup and Shutdown Sequence

### G.1 Startup

1. Operating system loads the executable image.
2. `_InitExe` (or `_InitLib` for DLLs) is called.
3. The memory manager is initialized.
4. Exception handling support is initialized.
5. `System` unit initialization runs.
6. `SysInit` unit initialization runs.
7. Unit initialization sections execute in dependency order (depth-first, left-to-right within each `uses` clause).
8. The program's main `begin..end` block executes.

### G.2 Shutdown

1. The main block completes (or `Halt` is called).
2. `ExitProc` chain is called (if any exit procedures are registered).
3. Unit finalization sections execute in **reverse** order of initialization.
4. The memory manager is shut down.
5. The process terminates with the exit code (`ExitCode` global variable or `Halt` parameter).
